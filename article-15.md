### Migrant Spouse Care and Counseling Fund Issues

<ol start="305">
  <li><p>Although the Migrant Spouse Fund has had some impact in the fields of Chinese language learning, parental education, marriage adjustment, care visits, medical and welfare assistance, job training, and nurturing of second generation immigrants; however, in the ten years of the fund’s existence it has been unable to resolve the following three major issues:<sup>78</sup></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>About 80% to 90% of the funds from the Migrant Spouse Fund that government agencies apply for yearly mix together both policy and assistance needs, making it difficult for government agencies to establish long-term policies that coincide with the actual requirements of their immigrant areas.</p></li>

      <li><p>The application process provides hidden incentive for organizations with available capabilities (government agencies with direct jurisdiction, large-scale charitablefoundations, or large for-profit enterprises) to enjoy a greater share of assistance by mastering the application and evaluation system to garner more funding, whereas organizations of comparably smaller scale or lacking familiarity with the application and auditing procedures (remote government agencies and grass-roots groups focused on immigration) face institutional discrimination. This makes certain organizations, which have the means to take advantage of loop-holes into long-term dependents of Migrant Spouse Fund subsidies.</p></li>

      <li><p>For community based groupsthe overly complicated and burdensome application process for the Migrant Spouse Fund impacts their willingness to undertake the process.Even the regulation’s standardized hourly teaching rates vary according to the level of education of the teachers. These types of assistance methods violate the spirit of empowering new immigrants to participate.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <li><p>In order to ensure conformity to the spirit of Paragraph 1 in Article 15 of the “International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights”, guarantee full economic, social and cultural development for all ethnic groups, determine whether 90% of the Migrant Spouse Fund granted over the past 10 years has gone to both the central and local governments, and check whether the majority of assistance goes towards medical and social needs, legal services or household assistance,<sup>79</sup> we recommend the elimination of the fund’s “short-term special case” pattern of subsidization. In its place local governments or relevant organizations should have control over normal operations so as to fully resolve issues of resource misallocation, waste and less-than-proportionately-fair sums going to local areas.</p></li>
</ol>

### Child Rights on Access to Culture

<ol start="307">
  <li><p>Response to Paragraph 318 of the State Report. Taiwan’s Ministry of Culture addresses only minors less than 12 years of age in the “Ministry of Culture Policy on Organizations Responsible for Culture and the Establishment of Child Discount Tariffs” for the provision of discounts and incentives based on age. However, for juveniles aged 12 to 17 no promotional measures for access to culture are listed. It is recommended to set out a concrete policy for access to culture for juveniles aged 12 to 17 as well as to consider including transportation expenses for those living outside metropolitan areas.</p></li>
</ol>

### Participation in Cultural Activities for People with Disabilities

<ol start="308">
  <li><p>The national policy on providing access to television for people with mental and physical disabilities relies too heavily on the broadcast obligations for public stations. Although review items for evaluation and change related to media access for those with vision and aural disabilities are set-up and classified as industry operations, however the review item “matters for other supervisory agencies” is only one small item amongst the lot, and the National Communications Commission has yet to set relevant policy planning for target values for fees, technology, and programming hours related to the promotion of television access.</p></li>

  <li><p>The National Communications Commission should expedite establishment of short/ mid/long-term policy programs on television access.</p></li>

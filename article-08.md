## Article 8 Labor Unions

### The Right to Form and Join Labor Unions

<ol start="123">
  <li><p>In response to Article 8 of the State Report on ICESCR concerning labor unions (hereafter referred to as “union”), amendments to <em>Act for Settlement of Labor-Management Disputes</em> in June 2009 and <em>Labor Union Act</em> in June 2010 have greatly benefited the development of unions. However, statistics announced by government labor departments show that amidst a progressive annual increase in the number of registered unions since 2011, the rate of national labor organizations has steadily declined between 2012 and 2015 (34.9% to 33.4%). Excluding members of confederated unions, the number of industrial union members in 2015 increased by 6,436 compared to the previous year. This growth was overshadowed by a sharp decrease in the number of enterprise and craft union members (4,084 and 18,930) compared to the previous year. The statistics therefore clearly indicate that fundamental unions in Taiwan are underperforming. The cause can be attributed to the union system characterized by the <em>Labor Union Act</em> and <em>Act for Settlement of Labor-Management Disputes</em>. Amidst high employment and the rapid rise in atypical workers, workers that fail to gain solidarity from unions will inevitably become the victims of economic development.</p></li>

  <li><p>We propose the following suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>According to current laws, workers are only permitted to organize industrial, enterprise, and craft unions, which inhibit union diversification. These laws should be amended to support free organization and, by extension, union diversification. For example, the organization of craft unions within enterprises is permitted in Japan.</p></li>

      <li><p>Currently, union strikes are only admissible for interest disputes, unfair labor practice by the employer, and hostile collective bargaining. Moreover, calls to strike must garner the approval of no less than half of all union members by means of direct and secret balloting, and the legitimacy of strikes are determined by local labor authorities. Therefore, union strikes in Taiwan receive considerably more political interference than those in the United States or Japan, which are regulated by independent authorities. As a resolve, the unduly constraints on unions’ right to dispute should be lifted. Unions should be authorized to self-govern their labor affairs, which would make them liable for the consequences of their dispute behaviors.</p></li>

      <li><p>According to current laws, teachers and workers who are employed by the Department of Defense and its affiliated agencies (institutes) or schools are prohibited from participating in strikes. Water supply businesses, power and fuel supply businesses, hospitals, securities businesses, financial information services businesses, and telecommunication providers may call to strike when the minimal operations are maintained. Local governments may force arbitration on and terminate disputes that are considered a breach of public interest. This regulation equates to the direct deprivation of union dispute rights. The restrictions on unions’ bargaining and dispute rights should be loosened.</p></li>

      <li><p>Currently, local labor authorities are tasked with handling affairs concerning parties and negotiators engaged in collective bargaining. A dedicated “National Labor Relations Board” should be established within the Board of Decisions on the Unfair Labor Practices to address relevant affairs.</p></li>

      <li><p>Unfair labor practices are characterized by private rights and non-private rights violations. Parties dissatisfied with the ruling of private and non-private rights violations can submit an appeal through civil and administrative action, respectively. The latter forfeits the protection that the adjudication system offers to unions and collective bargaining. The homogeneity of unfair labor practice dispute should be maintained to achieve a unified remedial procedure.</p></li>

      <li><p>According to current laws, an industrial or craft union pertains the right to collective bargaining once it represents fifty percent or more of an enterprise’s workers. This clause is often disputed. As a resolve, the mode of operation adopted in the United States can be implemented, whereby a secret ballot is used to garner no less than one-half of member votes. The ballot should be hosted by the <em>National Labor Relations Board</em> to maintain impartiality and unify standards across all county/city labor affairs bureaus.</p></li>

      <li><p>A dedicated labor court and provisions concerning legal dispute procedures should be established to address labor dispute issues.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Teachers’ Solidarity Rights Remain Restricted

<ol start="125">
  <li><p>In response to Article 8 of the <em>State Report on ICESCR</em> concerning the restrictions of teachers’ solidarity rights, teachers may organize county/city-level industrial and craft unions. However, they are prohibited from organizing enterprise unions (school unions). Private school teachers largely refrain from joining unions in fear of negatively influencing their relation with their employers. The acute decline in birth rate in Taiwan has hindered student recruitment, particularly in private schools, consequently leading to wage and research fund cuts. Private school teachers are defenseless against the school’s decisions and almost no unions are available to represent teachers in bargaining and settling with the employer.</p></li>

  <li><p>Civil servants are prohibited from organizing labor unions. Firefighters have requested the right to organize a labor union for two years but to no avail. Currently, only the National Association for Firefighters’ Rights is available to firefighters. The convener of the association, former Kaohsiung firefighter Mr. Kuo-Yao Hsu, received over 40 reprimands by the Kaohsiung City Government Fire Bureau for a variety of reasons within a span of several months in 2014, eventually leading to dismissal<sup>24</sup>.</p></li>

  <li><p>The leave for union-related business (LURB) for teacher union representatives is not protected by law and exhibit unreasonable limitations. The <em>Labor Union Act</em> only provisions for the LURB of enterprise union representatives. Unlike enterprise unions, other union representatives seeking LURB must bargain with their employers. Advancements in the provisions for the LURB of national/city/county craft and industrial unions have remained relatively stagnant since their promulgation roughly four years ago, and representatives are forced to continue using the LURBs provisioned for teachers’ associations. However, county/city majors and principles have threatened on numerous occasions to cancel LURB due to its lack of legal protection. Subsequently, the Control Yuan announced the <em>Jiao-Jheng-Zhi-Di No. 00115 (2014)</em> in July 2015, stating that the LURB of teachers unions has no legal basis. This led to the Major of Tainan County canceling the LURB of teachers unions and deferring the consult of LURB for teachers unions.</p></li>

  <li><p>The <em>Labor Union Act</em> stipulates that employers shall reasonably provide LURB to directors or supervisors of labor unions. However, provisions fail to include non-directing/supervising members. The Ministry of Labor has also expressed concerns regarding this matter. However, the Control Yuan announced the <em>Jiao-Tiao-Zhi-Di No. 0050 (2014)</em><sup>25</sup>, which was a survey report on the LURB of teachers unions, explicitly limiting LURB to directors and supervisors of labor unions. These provisions enabled city/county governments and school principals to reject to bargaining LURB from non-directing/supervising unions members on <em>Jiao-Tiao-Zhi-Di No. 0050 (2014)</em>. These actions clearly constitute the improper intervention of union members’ autonomy. The Control Yuan further stipulated in <em>Jiao-Jheng-Zhi-Di No. 00115 (2014)</em> that the LURB principles negotiated between the Ministry of Education and the National Federation of Teachers Unions (NFTU) are illegal.</p></li>

  <li><p>Nantou Teachers’ Union submitted a request to the Control Yuan in November 2014 to investigate the illegal ability grouping of a certain middle school and the negligence of the country government. The request was revoked by the county council with comments such as, “You are a civil servant. How can you sue the county major?” and “using LURB to disrupt the education system.” The council member moved to abolish LURB, to which the county major surprisingly concurred.</p></li>

  <li><p>We suggest that basic protection for the LURB of craft and industry unions should be included in the <em>Labor Union Act</em> to provision for instances in which enterprise unions cannot be organized. Additional protection or room for bargaining should then be provided based on the number of union members. Furthermore, a request should be submitted to the Control Yuan for abolishing the <em>Jiao-Tiao-Zhi-Di No. 0050 (2014)</em>, which is a clear violation of the Two Covenants. LURB should not only be limited to directing/supervising union members.</p></li>

### Collective Agreement Legislature

<ol start="131">
  <li><p>In response to Article 8, Paragraphs 105 to 107, of the <em>State Report on ICESCR and ICCPR</em> concerning collective agreement legislature issues, the amendments to the <em>Collective Agreement Act</em> in 2008 and 2014 enforced the obligation of employers to bargain in good faith, specified the bargaining period, and proposed supporting measures to handle disputes effectively. If the employer expresses no willingness to reach an agreement and the bargaining period extends over a period of six months, and if the employer is ruled without reason for disagreement based on the <em>Settlement of Labor-Management Disputes Act</em>, the competent authority rule for arbitration after considering the interests of both parties. According to the statistics announced by the Ministry of Labor, the number of collective agreement cases increased from 300 to 644 between 2014 and 2015, suggesting that the establishment of the adjudication system has a positive effect on the collective bargaining of unions. However, only 664 effective collective agreements have been produced from 5,424 unions nationwide, highlighting that although the <em>Collective Agreement Act</em> facilitates collective bargaining, negotiating entities (unions) are in recession. Therefore, the <em>Collective Agreement Act</em> only benefits those capable of negotiating. In actuality, these unions are typically capable of forming collective agreements without the support of government legislature.</p></li>

  <li><p>Several flaws remain evident in the existing collective bargaining system:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The eligibility of relevant parties involved in collective bargaining influences the confidentiality of union members differently. During the bargaining process, employers often question the eligibility of the labor representatives (unions) For example, employers generally request that representatives of industrial or craft unions to present a list of members of their union to verify that fifty percent of the employees are members of the union. This affects the anonymity of the union members.</p></li>

      <li><p>Only union members are permitted to participate in the bargaining process. This hinders external professionals from assisting in the bargaining process. According to Article 8 of the <em>Collective Agreement Act</em>, bargaining representatives are limited to union members or employer organizations unless written consent is obtained for the participation of external parties. These regulations are clearly targeted at employees because they often require professional counsel for specialized aspects of the agreement, for which they require written consent from the employer, consequently leading to unfair bargaining situations.</p></li>

      <li><p>Certain employees require the gain the approval of their competent authorities before they are able to sign the collective agreement. Article 10 of the <em>Collective Agreement Act</em> stipulates that collective agreement must be approved by a competent authority when one party is a public-owned business entity, subordinate agency (institute) or school of the Ministry of Defense, a government agency (institute), or a public school. This regulation renders the signing of collective agreements extremely tedious. For example, Yilan County Teacher Union engaged in 14 consults with the Yilan County Government (school representative). The terms and conditions of the agreement were revised from 52 to 30, two of which remain pending, and only 20 reached consensus. Moreover, the county government (competent authority) only approved the agreement after an extensive period. In this instance, Yilan County Government served both as the employer’s representative and as the competent authority.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>As a resolve to the aforementioned flaws:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The eligibility of the bargaining parties should be determined by the National Labor Relations Board. When the eligibility of the bargaining parties is questioned, the eligibility of the unions can be determined by the National Labor Relations Board to avoid unnecessary deference in bargaining time. The commissioning of an impartial third party not only alleviates disputes effectively but also safeguards the anonymity of the enterprise union members, eliminating them from becoming the targets of future harassment.</p></li>

      <li><p>The limitation on the participation of bargaining representative should be revised to enable unions to invite professional counsel without consent from the employer, thereby balancing bargaining situations, and ensuring that employees receive professional assistance during the bargaining process.</p></li>

      <li><p>The requirement to gain the approval of competent authorities before signing bargaining agreements should be eliminated. Instead, competent authorities can participate in the bargaining process to express their opinions and prevent the violation of law enforcement or prohibition. This approach can further reduce the time required to sign bargaining agreements and prevent the aforementioned situation in which the employer representative doubled as the approving competent authority.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Teachers’ Unions and Collective Agreement

<ol start="134">
  <li><p>The development of collective agreements (hereafter referred to as “agreements”) is extremely slow. The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Labor stand idly by as teacher union agreements become stigmatized. The Ministry of Labor claimed that between 2006 and 2014, the number of agreements has increased from 75 to 300. Among which, close to 200 agreements were signed by the Kaohsiung Teacher Union (KTU) and various schools in Kaohsiung City. These agreements only contain a single term, that is, “Schools shall withhold membership fees.” Therefore, these agreements can only count towards one agreement, and its symbolic value greatly outweighs substantive meaning. Minus the 200 agreements signed with private schools, only a few agreements signed with public and private enterprises remain.</p></li>

  <li><p>In an agreement between Yilan County Teacher Union and the Yilan County Government signed mid-2015 clearly stipulated teachers shall work no more than eight hours each day. This provision was maliciously attacked by an anonymous newspaper, the National Association of Head Teachers, anonymous parent group, and county council members, claiming that the provision “obstructed children’s right to education.” Moreover, the Minister of Education publically announced, “Teachers must be present when students are presents,” implying that teachers’ duty hours should be extended indefinitely. The Ministry of Labor made no response to this statement and failed to promote the importance of the agreements publically and defend the universal value of working no more than eight hours a day. On 26 September 2015, the Yilan County Mayor responded to a query proposed by a council member by stating that he disagrees that teachers are laborers. Since the promulgation of the <em>Labor Union Act</em> in 2011, which enabled teachers to form unions, only 3 private schools have signed agreements facilitated by the NFTU.</p></li>
</ol>

### Right to Strike and Arbitration:

<ol start="136">
  <li><p>Teacher unions are prohibited from striking. No progress has been made concerning this prohibition for two years. The arbitration mechanism is considered an improper intervention by administrative institutions. In response to the concluding observations and recommendations proposed during the First International Review, the Ministry of Labor introduced the arbitration mechanism into the <em>Act for Settlement of Labor-Management Disputes</em> legally enabling teacher unions to strike. However, arbitration committees are located in local labor bureaus (offices) and their members are elected by the county or city, making the susceptible to government influence. NFTU member unions had previously proposed two arbitration cases. The one was a dispute between KTU and the Kaohsiung City Education Bureau concerning remuneration for extra duty hours during lunchtime in elementary and middle schools. No substantive agreement was reached. Rather, the court merely ruled that the Education Bureau should enter bargaining with the union in accordance with the <em>Collective Agreement Act</em>. The second was a dispute between the Teachers Union of Taichung City and the Taichung City Government concerning supervisory duties in elementary and middle schools. During bargaining, the Taichung City Government insisted that the Arbitration Committee “reinitiate a tribunal.” Sources state that the government’s insistence stemmed from their inferior bargaining position. As a result, a court ruling has yet to be formulated although the statutory deadline has passed. Moreover, existing arbitrary decisions continue to be deferred, which elevates the risk of change exponentially. The NFTU publically expressed their opposition during a press conference held on 22 March 2016. These instances clearly show that Taiwan’s labor arbitration system, which was initially aimed to be fair and credible, is tainted by government intervention.</p></li>

  <li><p>An adjudication system is incorporated into the <em>Act for Settlement of Labor-Management Disputes</em>, established in the Ministry of Labor. The initial decisions of the Arbitration Committee were relatively fair. However, the aforementioned amendments made by the Control Yuan on the LURB of teacher unions have had a considerable impact on the decisions of the Arbitration Committee. Unions without LURB cannot maximize their potential. Teacher unions believe that the right to strike should be decided upon by the unions themselves rather than relying on alternative support mechanisms such as adjudication or arbitration.</p></li>

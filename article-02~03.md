### The State Report’s Failure to Present the Actual Number of Sexual Harassment Complaints and Implement the Legislation on Gender Equality

<ol start="60">
  <li><p>In Paragraph 19 of the State Report captioned “Statistics of Sexual Harassment Cases”, the government fails to show the actual situation of sexual harassment, presenting only those cases in violation of the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act (SHPA). However, depending on the relationship between the victim and the offender and where sexual harassment occurs, the applicable law for filing a complaint can be the <em>Gender Equality Education Act or the Gender Equality in Employment Act</em> instead. Merely in the year of 2014, 3,013 and 127 complaints are filed separately under the latter two Acts<sup>17</sup>. Added up with the 549 cases under SHPA, the total number of complaints in 2014 amounts to 3,698, which is much higher than 1,389, i.e. the number of cases filed “between 2012 and September 2015”, as recorded in the State Report.</p></li>

  <li><p>Article 7 of the SHPA stipulates that if the number of the staff, employees or customers of any organizations, troops, schools, institutions or employers reaches over ten, “an appeal channel for mediation and handling should be set up”; and if the number of people reaches over thirty, “measures for sexual harassment prevention should be formulated and be publicly announced”. Nevertheless, many businesses in the service sectors fails to comply with such regulations, yet the competent authorities<sup>18</sup> are idle in monitoring and rectifying non-compliances. We particularly urge the government to be more active in inspecting the formulation and improvement of measures for sexual harassment prevention in public places and service industries.</p></li>

  <li><p>In Taiwan, the number of cases of sexual harassment on campus is on the rise year by year: while 145 cases occurred in 2006, 3,013 happened in 2014. Furthermore, over 40 percent of them took place in junior high schools, which notably shows the government’s failure to fully implement the education on gender equality. The competent authorities shall initiate studies and investigations as soon as possible to find resolutions to the potential causes.</p></li>

  <li><p>For recommendations on how to carry out the <em>Gender Equality in Employment Act</em> and prevent sexual harassment in workplace, please refer to Paragraph 36 – 38 of this report regarding Article 7.</p></li>

  <li><p>Article 17 of the <em>Gender Equality Education Act</em> requires elementary and junior high schools to “provide at least four hours of courses or activities on gender equity education each semester”, but most of the schools meet the requirement by arranging lectures for an entire grade or even an entire school, which brings about little effect. The government shall encourage schools to design courses or activities on gender equality on the basis of classes that deal with the particular conditions and issues among the class of students.</p></li>

  <li><p>The current legislation, or the three <em>Acts</em> mentioned in Paragraph 1, has caused trouble for law enforcement. Practical experiences show that most people do not understand how to apply the law and make complaints in different situations of sexual harassment. We call upon the government to examine the cases happened in recent years and propose corresponding solutions on the problem of execution.</p></li>

### Unfriendly “Disabled-Friendly” Financial Service

<ol start="66">
  <li><p>According to Paragraph 15 of the <em>State Report</em> captioned “Friendly Financial Protection Measures”, the government requires banks to provide barrier-free ATMs and online service at their operating sites, and a total of 224 voice-enabled ATMs had been set up throughout Taiwan. In fact, only 60 percent of those machines are friendly to wheelchair users, while less than one-tenth of them are virtually barrier-free to use for persons with visual impairment. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the service is geographically evenly spread across the country. The current 42 banks that provide “disabled-friendly” service consider mainly the dissemination of information, such as interest rate or exchange rate inquiry. Only 15 banks provide barrier-free online banking services, which are not really easy to use, as reported by some visually impaired users.</p></li>

  <li><p>Paragraph 3, Article 107 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> stipulates that “if, at the time a life insurance contract is entered into, the insured is mentally impaired or of diminished mental capacity that he or she is incapable of comprehending his or her own action or lacks the ability to act based on his or her comprehension, all death benefits other than funeral expense benefits shall be void.” The government ought not to allow the life insurance company by law to deprive the persons with disabilities of their insurance benefits in the name of “protection”.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend the financial institutions to prioritize the replacement of unfriendly ATMs with barrier-free ones in public places such as traffic stations, hospitals, marketplaces and convenient stores; and to gradually meet the goal that there be at least one barrier-free ATM at every location installed with ATMs. </p></li>

  <li><p>We urge the government to add the barrier-free online banking service to the list of necessary transaction services that financial institutions must provide.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government shall review Article 107 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> and other unreasonable laws and policies regarding insurance, ensuring that persons with disabilities enjoy their rights to insurance. Also, it shall design educational and training programs for insurance companies and salespersons to facilitate their understanding of people with disabilities.</p></li>

## Article 6 the Right to Work

<ol start="71">
  <li><p>For unemployment discriminations confronting the Indigenous Peoples, please refer to Paragraphs 17 – 21 in the Special Chapter on Indigenous Peoples of the Covenants Watch ICCPR Shadow Report.</p></li>
</ol>

### Assistance to Young People in Employment

<ol start="72">
  <li><p>Responding to Paragraph 36 of the State Report, we especially recommend the government to provide young people aged from 16 to 24 who enter workplaces for the first time with related employment service facilities.</p></li>
</ol>

### Assistance to Persons with Disabilities in Employment 

<ol start="73">
  <li><p>Even though Paragraph 32 of State Report specifies the “quantity” of employment increases among persons with disabilities from 2012 to 2015,<sup>19</sup> the government fails to elaborate on and analyze the “quality” of these jobs. In fact, many persons with disabilities are employed as temporary workers or contractual personnel. It once happened to a person with disability that the school which hired him unfairly ended his employment contract when an accident caused disability to another regular employee, whose newly-acquired “disability card” would then satisfy that school’s need to employ sufficient percentages of persons with disabilities under Article 29 – 31 of the <em>Physically and Mentally Disabled Citizens Protection Act</em>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Everyone has the right to work. While the labor rights of Indigenous women and new immigrant women are brought to light in documents prepared by the Ministry of Labor such as <em>New Thinking on Women’s Labor Rights</em> (2008) and <em>White Paper on Labor Policy for Women</em> (2013), yet women with disabilities totally disappear in the discussion. We encourage the Ministry to put more emphasis on the labor rights of the women with disabilities.</p></li>
</ol>

### Protections and Restrictions of the Right to Work 

<ol start="75">
  <li><p>When the <em>Labor Standards Act</em> (LSA) was first enacted in 1984, it mainly applied to laborers working in the manufacturing industries; it was not until the Amendment passed in 1997 that the service industries are gradually included in the Act. Nevertheless, today some professional workers and particular types of jobs are still excluded from the application of LSA, which restricts these laborers from the regulations that protect their labor rights.<sup>20</sup></p></li>

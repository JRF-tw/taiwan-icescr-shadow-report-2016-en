## Article 7 Conditions of Work

### Gender Salary Gap, Occupational Sex Segregation and Atypical Employment that Deprive Women from Having Equal Payment

<ol start="76">
  <li><p>The percentage of women employed in atypical jobs is increasing on a yearly basis, coming to 7.64% as of May 2015, which is higher than that of men (6.46%).<sup>21</sup> The main cause is women’s presumed role as birth- and caregiver; the ensued interruptions of work and difficulties of re-entering the workforce result in a higher tendency for women to accept atypical work and compromise on lower wage level, labor standard and elderly economic security than regular employees.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government ought to put Article 10 of the <em>Gender Equality in Employment Act</em> into real practice, which pledges that employees shall receive equal pay for equal work or equal value”, by actively setting strategic goals and finding concrete ways to reduce discriminations confronting women in the workplace and promote gender equality in employment. According to the Ministry of Labor, women earn just 85.5% of what men do. In other words, women must work 54 more days to earn just the same annual income as men.<sup>22</sup> Before equal work receives equal pay for all, we still have a long way to go.</p></li>

  <li><p>In addition, serious occupational sex segregation and inequality still persist in the workplace. In the labor market, stereotypically “female” jobs are payed lower wage than those “male” jobs. For example, obstetricians and midwives have obviously different wage rates despite the similarity of their work. We can never stop gender discrimination at workplace if the segregation remains unbroken.</p></li>

  <li><p>For now, the strategic goal and concrete way means dealing with discriminations confronting women in the workplace, and promote gender equality in employment.</p></li>

  <li><p>To ensure “equal pay for equal work”, we recommend the government to push for salary transparency to prevent pay gaps hidden behind information asymmetry. The government can add the principle to the criteria for labor inspection, so as to prevent employers from taking advantage of disobeying laws.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government should initiate the development of a “work value scale” based on the content of jobs and the nature of tasks that would reflect the true value of different occupations, which serves as one step to reduce discriminations and pay gaps against the presumed “female” jobs. The government can adopt the principle of “equal pay for equal work” in enterprise evaluation, encouraging all companies to join hands in promoting gender equality.</p></li>

  <li><p>Conforming to the <em>Labor Standards Act</em>, the <em>Employment Service Act</em> and the <em>Labor Union Act</em>, the government ought to protect laborers from exploitation by middleman, complete the gender impact assessment and gendered statistical analysis on atypical employment, and examine women’s double exploitation under the abuse of labor dispatch or part-time/temporary employment, so as to avoid women from getting trapped in the vicious circle of three “L’s” (Low Payment, Low Protection and Low Achievement) in their working environments.</p></li>

  <li><p>The ongoing reform program of the National Pension Insurance (NPI) should not overlook gender factors. Instead of simply basing the calculation on occupation or seniority, the NPI system should guarantee that irregular employees shifting between different types of social insurance programs and caregivers at home who have no occupational pension, women in particular, need not want for economic security in their old age.</p></li>
</ol>

### Female Workers without Permits Easily Targeted for Harassment and Rape

<ol start="84">
  <li><p>Paragraph 98 of the State Report states that the National Immigration Agency will provide workers without a permit who fall victim to human trafficking with “placement protection as well personal protection and necessary medical assistance”, but no corresponding measures and assistances are extended to those who suffer sexual harassment or rape. In practical experiences, workers without a permit dare less to speak up against violence, most of which are cases of sexual assaults and harassments, for fear that they would face forced repatriation after disclosing their identities.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend the government to establish a system of distress and impunity for workers without a permit who fall victim to sexual assaults and harassments, helping them in avoiding violence and providing subsequent assistance in conjunction with their home country’s Foreign Embassy or Representative Office in Taiwan.</p></li>
</ol>

### Dispatched Labor

<ol start="86">
  <li><p>The following Paragraphs are in response to Paragraphs 43 - 44 of the State Report concerning dispatched workers. Official statistics show that there are 498,000 temporary and dispatched workers in 2008; the number continued climbing from 539,000 and 574,000 in the year of 2010 and 2012 to reach 612,000 in 2015. In scholarly estimation, the number of dispatched workers cannot be less than 350,000. It can be seen that labor dispatch has increased constantly in Taiwan.</p></li>

  <li><p>According to the “Special Inspection on Labor Dispatch” conducted in 2009 by the Ministry of Labor, up to 86.4% of dispatch agencies are in violation of the current labor legislation, which seriously indicates the importance, and lack, of a special law and enforcement unit. However, the <em>Dispatched Workers Protection Act</em> drafted by the Ministry of Labor is dually oriented toward “safety” for the dispatched workers and “flexibility” for the manpower dispatch industry, while the two contradictory ideas (employment stability vs. industry development) give rise to conflicts in legislation. On the other hand, the current <em>Guiding Principles for the Rights of Dispatched Workers</em> consists of simply 6 Articles, which places its main focus on requiring the labor dispatching entities to meet their responsibilities under the <em>Labor Standards Act</em>, yet very little is demanded from the employers at the dispatched entities.</p></li>

  <li><p>Given to the government’s inability to curb the abuse of labor dispatch, NGOs submit various proposals in this regard. Some believe labor dispatch is by its very nature a breach of Article 6 of the LSA that “no person shall interfere in the labor contract of other persons and obtain illegal benefits therefrom”. Others recommends different ways of regulations such as amending the LSA by adding a special chapter on labor dispatch, or drafting a new act forbidding labor dispatch or else protecting dispatched workers.</p></li>

  <li><p>Therefore, we call for immediate legislation of the Dispatched Workers Protection Act, in which the following principles are essentially important:</p></li>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The labor dispatching entities are not allowed to make fixed-term but rather non-fixed-term employment contracts with the dispatched workers.</p></li>

      <li><p>After one full year of service, a dispatched worker may make a written request to the dispatched entity for job transfer into a regular position, which shall not be subject to the approval of the dispatched entity, as is stipulated in the current draft law.</p></li>

      <li><p>To ensure the principle of equal treatment, dispatched workers are entitled to the same labor rights and “basic terms and conditions” as the regular employees.</p></li>

      <li><p>Employers of the dispatched entities are expressly required to undertake their duties under the <em>Labor Standards Act, Gender Equality in Employment Act</em>, etc.</p></li>

      <li><p>In principle, except for the jobs positively specified on the list, employers of industries and businesses are not allowed to hire dispatched workers, whereas a maximum permitted proportion of hiring dispatched worker is to be determined.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government ought to manage the labor dispatching industry strictly by developing governing regulations and granting permission for establishing such entities.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </ol></ol>

### High Numbers of Dispatched Workers Employed in Governmental Organizations

<ol start="90">
  <li><p>According to Article 2 and Article 7 of the Government Procurement Act, the term “procurement” refers to “the contracting of construction work, the purchase or lease of property, the retention or employment of services, etc.”, while the term “service” means “professional services, technical services, information services, research and development, business operation management, maintenance and repair, training, labor and other services as determined by the responsible entity”. Therefore, the forms of labor procurement shall be restricted to “retention” or “employment”, which does not include “dispatch”. Even granting that it is acceptable in government procurement, dispatched labor should be utilized as professional service that assists in, rather than substituting for, the performance of the official duties.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Taiwanese government’s outright procurement and extensive use of dispatched labor constitutes violations of the Act. As the only country in the world to perform its official duties by dispatched workers, Taiwan not only fails to create reasonable job opportunities, but also directs large amounts of revenues to the manpower dispatch industry at the expense of dispatched workers who are weakened by overwork and low pay. Standing up against the government’s abuse of dispatch labor and the arising problems, we contend that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The government ought to reduce exploitation of laborers from middlemen and supersede all of its labor dispatch contracts by formal employment contracts within the limit of three years, which would create job opportunities in the public sector and provide a more stable employment environment.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government shall not misinterpret subcontracting relations to maintain de facto labor dispatch relations with the workers employed by the subcontractor, where many governmental authorities still exercise actual control and supervision of the contract workers.</p></li>

      <li><p>The Public Construction Commission under the Executive Yuan ought to install a service line for filing complaints against dispatching companies breaking law or contract. When a complaint is established, the Commission shall terminate the procurement contract immediately and add the company to the blacklist.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Working Hours

<ol start="92">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 58 of the State Report concerning working time, the annual average working time for Taiwanese employees is as high as 2,124 hours in official statistics. Despite the legal fact that the maximum normal working hours a week has been reduced to 40 under the LSA since January 1, 2016, the Ministry of Labor intends recently to increase the limit of overtime work from 46 to 54 hours, ignoring the “sweat” society exhausted from overwork. The main cause of the persistently high annual working hours in Taiwan is the government’s failure to enforce workers’ right to paid special leaves and official holidays as well as its tolerance of illegal overtime working.</p></li>

  <li><p>Therefore, our proposals are as follow:</p></li>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The government shall revise Article 36 of the LSA and guarantee that a worker shall have at least two, instead of one, regular day off per week.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government shall increase the overtime wage rate. At present, a worker whose overtime work does not exceed two hours shall be paid an additional one-third of the regular hourly rate, and two-third for the further two overtime hours. If a worker consent to work on a holiday, he/she shall be paid double the regular rate. Nevertheless, as the Ministry of Labor interprets that regular holiday pay is already included in the monthly salary, so the employers only pay the workers the “additional” one-fold wage of that particular day without doubling it. All of these wage rates lag behind international standards.</p></li>

      <li><p>The current legislation allows employers to distribute the regular working hours so unevenly that many workers have to sacrifice their health and family life for rotating schedules with 2 twelve-hour shifts. The government shall revise the LSA immediately to forbid such rotation system and protect workers’ right to rest with a compulsory break of at least 12 hours between successive work shifts.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government shall put to real effect the provision that employers shall pay wages to workers for their untaken annual paid leave, which should be stipulated not only in the <em>Enforcement Rules of the Labor Standards Act</em>, but also in the Act itself and supplemented by penal provisions to enforce the regulation.</p></li>
</ol>

### Special Regulations on Working Time

<ol start="94">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 59 of the State Report concerning special working hours, we hold that the root cause of overwork in Taiwan is the very Article 84-1 of LSA, which was a compromise in the amendment process to include the white-collar workers in the scope of application. With the approval of the Ministry of Labor, there are currently 39 types of workers who are not subject to the legal regulations on working hours, recess and holidays because of the “special nature” of their jobs. This turns out to serve as the employers’ excuse to evade overtime payment by arbitrarily defining their occupations as such particular jobs. Many workers who actually fall into this category are also unfamiliar with their legal rights, allowing the employers to omit the requirement of making a mutual agreement in written form, which shall be submitted to the local competent authorities for approval and record.</p></li>

  <li><p>Thus, we call for the immediate abolition of Article 84-1 of the <em>Labor Standard Act</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

### Labor Inspection

<ol start="96">
  <li><p>The following paragraphs are in response to Paragraph 60 of the State Report concerning labor inspections. According to the <em>2014 Annual Report of Labor Inspection</em>, 12,277 business entities underwent inspection on labor conditions in that year, while as many as 6,956 violations of legislation were found with over 97% of the cases involving the LSA. Nevertheless, most of the competent authorities just passively wait for labor complaints to initiate inspections. Given the public’s little understanding and awareness of their legal rights, what are shown in the statistics are probably just the tip of the iceberg.</p></li>

  <li><p>Therefore, our proposals are as follow:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The government shall increase the personnel and centralize the power of labor inspection. There are in average 0.42 labor inspectors per 10,000 workers in Taiwan, which is far less than EU standards. The ratio ought to be raised to 1 as soon as possible and progressively to 1.5. On the other hand, the authority competent to conduct labor inspections is decentralized disorderly not only to local governments from the special municipalities, but also to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Science and Technology at places such as Export Processing Zones and Science Parks. However, the inspection agencies governed by the latter two Ministries are not so much the supervisors of labor safety, health and conditions as the service providers for businesses in the zones/parks. Concentration of power to a central authority is key to professional and independent labor inspections.</p></li>

      <li><p>The authority to conduct a labor inspection shall be combined with the authority to make a corresponding administrative disposition so as to enhance deterrence and compliance. Many cases in the past that found violations of labor laws were not necessarily followed by penalties, for the ruling power resided in the local city and county governments, thereby countering the effects of labor inspections. In 2003, the Ministry of Labor decided to bring the power to make administrative dispositions concerning the <em>Occupational Safety and Health Act</em> (OSHA) back to the Central Authority and the six Special Municipalities, yet leaving the LSA unaltered. Ten years after, the disposal rate involving the OSHA has increased to 27%, while that involving the LSA stayed as low as 3%.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Gender Equality in Employment Act and Prevention of Sexual Harassment in Workplace

<ol start="98">
  <li><p>In Paragraphs 25 – 26 under the caption of “Laws, Regulations, and Measures Protecting Employment Right”, the State Report fails to elaborate on: (1) the reasons for, and the corresponding measures after, deciding to review, not to review, or to cancel a case of complaint filed under Paragraph 2, Article 11 of the <em>Gender Equality in Employment Act</em>; (2) the implementation situation of penalties on employers discriminating against applicants and employees because of their gender or sexual orientation since the 2014 amendment that raises the fines for violating Article 7 – 11 of the <em>Act</em>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Responding to Paragraphs 43 and 62 concerning the measures for sexual harassment prevention, there still exist some flaws and restrictions in the <em>Act</em>. As practical experiences show, not all sexual harassment occurring at workplaces can be properly handled by the Act. For instance, if an employee is sexually harassed by a person from another company when performing his/her job duty outside, his/her employer is obliged to take remedial measures under current legislation. However, besides investigations of facts, little substantive assistance is provided to the victim. In addition, not a few victims would decide to stay silent after the occurrence of workplace sexual harassment for fear of the negative impact on their career advancement.</p></li>

  <li><p>The committees on gender equality in employment of each city and county government are the frontline agencies to accept cases of alleged violations of the Act, but practically, they are often handled by the Employment Discrimination Review Committees set up under the <em>Employment Service Act</em>. When there are as many as 16 forbidden grounds for employment discrimination, either the central or the local governments have sufficient manpower to fulfill the mandate: in some cities and counties, only one person is exclusively dedicated to these tasks, while some other local governments assign the duty jointly to their personnel. For lack of expertise and manpower, it is really difficult for the committees to investigate cases of discrimination, promote public educations, etc. Many of the committees on gender equality in employment review less than ten or even zero complaints in a year.</p></li>

  <li><p>Compared with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the United States, which grants full power of investigation to the investigator and anticipates thorough interviews into cases of discrimination, most of the committees on gender equality in employment in Taiwan are not capable of such active investigations, but passively wait for complaints and the handle the appeals through written proceedings.</p></li>

  <li><p>To ensure real gender equality and stop gender discrimination in the workplace, a comprehensive reform of the current mechanism for accepting and reviewing complaints under the <em>Act</em> is necessary. Only by setting up service desks in every districts by the agencies affiliated to the central competent authority can professional civil service be guaranteed.</p></li>
</ol>

### Safety at Work and Prevention of Occupational Hazards

<ol start="103">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 66 of the <em>State Report</em>, the prevention of occupational injuries in Taiwan mainly relies on the labor inspection mechanism and the <em>Occupational Safety and Health Act</em>, a substantial amendment of which in 2013 went into effect one year after. In spite of 87 regulations and enforcement rules, the normative clauses outlined in the <em>Act</em> remain symbolic for lack of public promotion and assistance/coordination measures.</p></li>

  <li><p>Labor rights infringement by business prevails in Taiwan; the competent authorities at each level with insufficient staffing are slow in action to correct and punish the wrongdoings. For the majority of the 1,450,000 registered factories and business entities, less than one labor inspection is carried out in thirty years. In 2014, the number of inspections on labor condition is 12,277, including the re-examinations conducted on a same business entity. With the finding of 4,135 violations of the Labor Standard Act, the disposal rate comes to 33.68%. On the other hand, 90,942 business entities underwent inspections on occupational safety and health, while 6.07% (5520 cases) are found guilty. Even so, the violations established are rarely penalized judicially, incentivizing business to take advantage of non-compliance.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend the government to increase the staffing of labor inspectors to 1 per 10,000 workers in Taiwan, and plan to raise the ratio progressively to 1.5. To ensure professional and independent labor inspections, the mechanism shall be managed and supervised by one single central authority. Also, an independent authority to make a corresponding administrative disposition ought to be integrated so as to prevent interference from other administrative agencies.</p></li>
</ol>

### Public Workers Uncovered by the Labor Standards Act or Full Protection of Reasonable Working Hours and Paid Vacations

<ol start="106">
  <li><p>A public servant shall be protected by Article 7 of <em>ICESCR</em>. A civil servant, who has strong obligations to obey the orders of his/her superiors and must work on rotating shifts (e.g. police and fire personnel), shall especially be protected by this Article because s/he faces more possibilities of suffering from exploitations resulting from his/her working conditions than other normal civil servants. But current protections are guarantees similar to that for normal civil servants. If there are any shortcomings, a ridiculous fact will thus arise: the government that shall be the model for private entities suppress its employees instead.</p></li>

  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 58 of the <em>State Report on ICESCR</em>, after several amendments, Labor Standards Act has already been codified a certain amount of articles concerning employer penal provisions, reasonable working hours, and reasonable recess time, which gives employees certain guarantees; However, according to J.Y. Interpretations No. 396, No. 433, and No. 637, a public servant is not protected by <em>Labor Standards Act</em> because there is a civil service public law relationship between civil servants and the State. Therefore, provisions regarding maximum working hours limit are not applicable to civil servants. Only <em>Regulations of Implementation Program for the Civil Servants’ Two-day Weekend</em>, which is without penalty and roughly codified, is applicable.<sup>23</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>According to <em>Regulations of Implementation Program for the Civil Servants’ Two-day Weekend</em>, public servants’ daily working hours are 8 hours, and weekly working hours are 40 hours in total; However, according to the statistics of working hours of a public servant working on rotating shifts, such as police personnel, his/her monthly working hours are between 244 and 264 hours. In other words, about 68 to 88 hours monthly overtime, over 8 hours daily overtime,over 40 hours weekly overtime, and over 12 hours daily normal working time along with expansion working time of a police officer are already common, which from a profound gap between legal regulations and the reality.</p></li>

  <li><p>Due to staff shortage, a civil servant working on rotating shifts often has to face split shifts and continuous overtime shifts, which posts severe harm to his/her physical and mental health, and violates Clause 4, Article 7 of <em>ICESCR</em>, in which the assurance of “rest, leisure and reasonable limitation of working hours……” has been codified. The government’s omission, including no legal guarantee, no act of recruitment, and no attempt to lower the need of high workings hours of police and fire personnel, instead, causes general police officers and fire safety personnel have to work overtime and work for excessive shifts in a day.</p></li>

  <li><p>Therefore, we suggest that the labor condition of public servants shall be covered by regulations that equal or superior to <em>Labor Standards Act</em>: government employees are the key component of the administrative system to operate the state; however, the labor condition and the protection for public servants supporting state operation is instead ridiculously inferior to that in private entities. It is still understandable that there are special regulations regulating labor condition and working hours for governmental organizations concerning their distinctive features, but such labor condition protection shall not be inferior to the protection for general employees. If there are any shortcomings, civil servants shall have the right to claim to apply the related provisions of Labor Standards Act. Looking back at the spirit of <em>ICESCR</em>, which aims at guaranteeing all citizens’ safe and healthy working environment, there is no reason for the state to ignore the labor condition protections for public servants and regard them as the second-class citizens as the state itself is the employer and hires the most employees in the country.</p></li>

  <li><p>We believe that, besides <em>Labor Standards Act</em>, the related provisions applicable to public servants shall be amended in order to substantially guarantee general public servants’ right to work, or that public servants can be applicable to <em>Labor Standards Act</em> when regulations applicable to public servants are inferior to the Act. We suggest that future amendments shall include the following principles:</p></li>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Respecting to administrative regulations and regulations related to the execution personnel, the government shall gather execution personnel to enact, amend, abolish, and review the laws, and gives the representatives of execution personnel the right to actively enact, amend, abolish, and review.</p></li>

      <li><p>Regulations for punishment effect public servants profoundly. Therefore, the government shall strengthen remedial procedures, such as gathering representatives of execution personnel to form an assemble and deliberate.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government shall set clear standards on daily and weekly working hours and punishment provisions for competent authorities that violate such standards as well.</p></li>

      <li><p>An impartial, non-governmental third-party organization can proceed examinations for governmental organizations. The violating organizations will be punished according to <em>Labor Standards Act</em> in order to substantially guarantee public servants’ right to work.</p></li>
</ol>

### The Need of a Labor Conditions Inspection for Public Servants Who Must Work on Rotating Shifts

<ol start="112">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 60 of the State Report on ICESCR, under the circumstances of lacking related protections and the fact that <em>Regulations of Implementation Program for the Civil Servants’ Two-day Weekend</em> provides that “Public Transportation, Police, Fire Department, Coast Guard, Medical Services, Customs, and other Government Departments, must provide service to the public all year round and so must implement the necessary shift systems (alternate duty / day-off),” the government shall especially proceed project investigations on labor conditions and propose solutions on schedule.</p></li>

  <li><p>The labor condition examination shall be organized by impartial third-parties, such as private think tanks, enterprise unions or academia specializing in labor rights, in order to avoid the situation of “self-refereeing” when the government conducts such examination itself. Such examination investigates labor conditions in each governmental organization, and the results will be considered in annual Performance Evaluations for executive officers and become reference for job promotions. If there is serious fomentation of violation, <em>Labor Standards Act</em> is applicable.</p></li>

  <li><p>We suggest that the remedial procedures for civil service punishment shall be strengthened: the remedial processes of a punishment, such as appeal, reappeal, or administrative litigations, are all approved by competent authorities or superior authorities. In order to maintain the image of their organizations, the competent authorities usually cannot judge objectively and impartially. The personnel who claims a remedy even faces strong pressures in his/her organization. For the establishment of a safe and healthy working environment, remedial processes of a civil service punishment shall be improved and be conducted by non-interested and credible authorities, or by representative groups formed by personnel that is or was responsible for the involved duties. The related punishments shall be suspended before the decisions are made.</p></li>

  <li><p>Improvements for procedures of formulation and amendments of administrative regulations: the formulation and amendments of administrative regulations within governmental authorities can only be implemented after being approved by representatives of related execution personnel gathered by the competent authorities. The right to actively amend or abolish such regulations that are out of dates and/or difficult to implement shall be given to execution personnel.</p></li>
</ol>

### The Government’s Act of Omission, the Detection Rate of Occupational Diseases for Civil Servants Working on Rotating Shifts Close to Zero

<ol start="116">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 66 of the <em>State Report on ICESCR</em>, according to Article 7 of <em>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</em>, the state parties shall ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of safe and healthy working conditions; however, civil servants who work on rotating shifts often have to face 12-hour shift, night shifts and split shifts. According to the report “Review and Improvements for Personnel Management and Attendance/vacation System of nationwide police and firefighter officers” submitted by National Police Agency to Executive Yuan in June 2013, the working hours of a police officer are roughly between 244 and 264 hours. In other words, a police officer’s monthly overtime is about 68 to 88 hours. Furthermore, according to No. 0014 of Corrective Measures on Ministry of the Interior issued by Control Yuan in 2010, due to the need to deal mass gathering, accidents, projects and temporary duties, police officers often cannot get off work on time or have to go to work during off-duty period. Overtime working thus becomes common. This working condition has caused certain percentage of occupational disease, such as Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia, Hypertension, Gastric Ulcer, Obesity, Bronchitis, Tonsillitis, and Sinusitis. However, there is no attention to such problems and medical costs subsidies as well. To make the matter worse, records of sick leaves have to be considered in the Performance Valuations, which make these kind of public servants would only make a leave as the last resort. This is the best example of a governmental murder.</p></li>
</ol>

### Wages and Labor Conditions of Teenagers

<ol start="117">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 47 of the <em>State Report on ICESCR</em>, according to the nationwide investigation on 15 to 18-year-old “part-time teenage workers” conducted by Taiwan Alliance for Advancement of Youth Rights and Social Welfare in 2014, there are up to 52% teenagers receive less than the minimum wage of NTD 115/per hour among 2925 responses. There are even 25% respondents still receive less than NTD 100 per hour.</p></li>

  <li><p>Among 2925 teenage part-time jobbers, except high percentage of them are payed less than minimum wages, 25% of them have experiences of wage deduction or paying fines, and 23.5% of them have once worked continuously over 7 days. In regard to labor insurances, only 40% teenage jobbers are insured by Labor Insurance, 35.8% of them do not know whether they are insured, even up to 18% teenagers are not protected by any labor insurances. According to the statistics of students’ injury and severe accidents at work from Institute of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health, there are up to 64 severe accidents happening during teenage students’ part-time works in recent 5 years (2008~2012). In addition, on campus, 328 injury events happen in laboratory or during internship, and up to 392 accidents happen during internship and part-time works.</p></li>

  <li><p><em>Labor Insurance Act</em> provides that firms with less than 5 employees are not subject to compulsory Labor Insurance. But the majority of minors works for such firms and is thus not protected by Occupational Accident Insurance. We suggest that the competent authorities shall first implement compulsory insurances for minors before amending related provisions of Occupational Accident Insurance.</p></li>
</ol>

### Online Breaking News Going Against the Labor Rights of Media Workers

<ol start="120">
  <li><p>Competition between internet news media is going against the labor rights of media workers, demanding reporters to spend long working hours making interviews and being rushed to release breaking news online. The first inspection on the labor conditions of news media, conducted by the Department of Labor of the Taipei City Government in 2014, found that all of the 34 news and media companies violated labor laws. The first three grounds are: (1) the prohibition of overtime application (79.4%); (2) the failure to keep Employee Attendance Records (76.5%); and the employer’s allowing their employees to work over 12 hours a day (70.6%). The media industry is part of Taiwan’s sweatshop industries that should not be overlooked.</p></li>

  <li><p>Besides, according to the questionnaire study by the Media Workers Unite, a rights group founded in 2014, the average weekly working time of media workers is 53.73 hours, more than that of all the industries by 8 hours. Some reporters say they used to work 36 hours with no rest, while others take not a single day off during a whole month. More than half of the interviewees feel mentally and physically exhausted, the main three causes of which are: receiving phone calls from their supervisors in midnight, frequent directions on and interventions in their report by the managers, and demanded to release breaking news. Studies also show that the most prevailing illnesses among the media workers are: “symptoms of spine, shoulder and neck or other muscle disease” (15%), “problems of mental health” (13%) and “sleep disorders” (about 1%).</p></li>

  <li><p>We urge that the labor union of media workers shall stand out as the front-line fighters of their rights, and that the government shall encourage them to establish labor unions and enhance their bargaining power as well as improving labor inspections in this field.</p></li>

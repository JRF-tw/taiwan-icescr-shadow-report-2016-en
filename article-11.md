## Article 11 Adequate Standard of Living (Right to Adequate Housing, Food, and Water)

### I. Proactively Meeting Housing Standards: Housing Policies

### Housing Discrimination (Paragraph 13 of the <em>State Report</em>)

<ol start="192">
  <li><p>Monetary subsidies are ineffective in resolving the long-lasting issue of housing discrimination in Taiwan’s housing market, because people who have specific identities or those who belong to certain groups are often subject to differential treatment in housing. Taiwan’s housing discrimination problem in the rental market is caused by an uncomprehensive legal system and market system, depriving fundamental protection for the rights of landlords and tenants. Landlords’ concerns regarding their own rights, a lack of effective dispute settlement mechanisms, and stereotypes are common causes to why disadvantaged groups or individuals are often denied when renting. Be it purchase, rental, or government-sponsored social housing, neighboring communities often object to specific groups moving in. However, the government generally does not resolve these problems on the principles of freedom of contract or free market.</p></li>
</ol>

### Housing Standards (Paragraph 213 of the <em>State Report</em>)

<ol start="193">
  <li><p>Although basic housing standards are defined in Article 34 of the Housing Act<sup>49</sup>, the following three problems remain an issue:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Indicator 1, “average minimum housing floor area per person,” may be exaggerated. Floor area is calculated based on general square meters<sup>50</sup> rather than actual square meters.</p></li>

      <li><p>Indicator 2, “types and number of important housing facilities,” only include the number of “toilets,” “urinals,” “basins,” and “bathtub or shower,” (with one each per housing unit), which is insignificant as it results in substandard housing.</p></li>

      <li><p>No proactive supporting plans exist for improving the conditions of the 170,000 households considered as substandard housing. According to Article 34 of the Housing Act, basic housing standards are only used as a basis for “housing policy planning and determining housing subsidies.”<sup>51</sup></p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>Recommendation: Conduct a comprehensive investigation on the housing conditions of substandard households and stipulate an implementation plan that highlights counseling and improvements, and employ supporting measures such as providing housing subsidies, thereby fulfilling the goal of policies established for governing basic housing standards.</p></li>
</ol>

### Housing Information Transparency (Paragraph 214 of the <em>State Report</em>)

<ol start="195">
  <li><p>Housing information transparency only applies to purchases/sales, whereas information transparency pertaining to rentals or other related areas are undervalued.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Home purchases: Taiwan currently exhibits inadequate regulatory oversight over the rental market. Although relevant laws were amended in 2011 to mandate the registration of actual real-estate transaction prices, many loopholes<sup>52</sup> have resulted in consumers facing difficulties in obtaining information on actual housing prices.</p></li>

      <li><p>Rentals: The registration of actual real-estate transaction prices is exclusively for the purchasing and sales of houses. Excluding houses processed by realtors, houses for rent do not apply to the regulation mentioned above. However, 90% of Taiwan’s houses for rent are leased by individuals or small landlords. Less than 10% of houses for rent are managed by realtors, which indicates that rental information on the registration system does not accurately reflect the condition of the rental market.</p></li>

      <li><p>Additional housing information: In addition to the purchase, sales, and rental of houses, the government should investigate and publicize problems related to the lack of completeness and accuracy of other housing-related information.<sup>53</sup></p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Property Tax System (Paragraphs 214 and 215 of the <em>State Report</em>)

<ol start="196">
  <li><p>Taiwan’s property tax and transaction tax are overly lenient, and the property tax system is unreasonable, which are the primary causes of land speculation, hoarding, and commercial monopoly. In June 2015, amendments to Taiwan’s Income Tax Act were completed (property and land income are jointly taxed regularly based on actual cost). However, two major loopholes exist, namely, the amendments only apply to land or property transacted starting in 2016, and the tax exemption of NTD $4 million on housing investment profit is unreasonable.</p></li>

  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 214 of the State Report, which claims that the percentage of current land value to market value will be adjusted annually, current land value serves as a basis for transaction tax and thus should equate to market value. Although the percentage has increased in recent years, data for the various counties and cities are exaggerated to different extents. For example, the current land value for tax-exempt land may be increased.</p></li>
</ol>

### Social Housing (Paragraph 217 of the <em>State Report</em>)

<ol start="198">
  <li><p>In 2011, the Ministry of the Interior published the Survey on Demand for Social Housing by Disadvantaged Families, which states that a total of 185,262 houses were needed in Taiwan’s five municipalities, among which 31,114 were in Taipei City, and 52,439 were in New Taipei City. However, random sampling was conducted only on disadvantaged families and those working in the primary sector. The government has failed to elucidate the actual housing demands of the disadvantaged, which leads to a severe deficiency in protecting the rights of the disadvantaged in relevant plans.<sup>54</sup> Furthermore, young people were not included in the survey but have since become the primary group that social housing is focused on.<sup>55</sup> The age limits on social housing applicants reflect a neglect of the housing demands for those aged 45 and above, which also adversely encourages landlords to impose age limits.</p></li>

  <li><p>The <em>Housing Act</em> serves as a legal basis for social housing; however, details regarding the formulation and execution of social housing projects remain to be stipulated by local governments. For example, the <em>Regulations Governing the Rental of Social Housing in Taipei City</em> does not specify the proportion of houses guaranteed for disadvantaged families or principles for establishing rental rates. Rather than employ a tiered rental rate system in consideration for affordability and special needs, houses are leased at 70% to 80% of the market rate to disadvantaged families. This arrangement not only fails to ease housing burdens for the disadvantaged but also causes disadvantaged families to forfeit applying for social housing because of excessive rates or experience difficulties in paying rent on time, which are contradictory to the objectives of social housing projects.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Ministry of the Interior stipulated the <em>Short Term Implementation Plan for Social Housing and the Mid- to Long-Term Promotion Plan for Social Housing</em> in 2011 and 2014, respectively. The objective of the plans is to confirm the target number of houses and subsidy budget for the government’s social housing projects. However, the two projects did not consider the right to housing of the disadvantaged, and financial support for local governments was insufficient and in fact far from the financial demands of the practical implementation of relevant projects. Thus, local governments are often overly dependent on public-private partnerships when organizing social housing projects.<sup>56</sup></p></li>
</ol>

### Current Housing Conditions (Paragraph 216 of the <em>State Report</em>)

<ol start="201">
  <li><p>Taiwan’s housing market is characterized by a large number of purchases/sales (accounting for over 90% of the housing supply) an extremely small number of houses for rent on the surface (less than 10% of the housing supply), and an extremely small number of social houses and other forms of housing (less than 1% of the housing supply). In addition, Taiwan exhibits inadequate regulatory oversight (regarding housing prices) over the demand side of the housing market, which has resulted in severe land speculation in recent years. Furthermore, no oversight demands the transparency of prices, transactions, and other information for rentals, which indicates that the current condition of rentals cannot be elucidated. Thus, the data shown in Paragraph 216 of the State Report do not reflect the current housing conditions of the public. The data for rent-to-income ratio were sourced from cases managed by realtors, which only reflects a small portion of houses for rent and does not include houses leased by independent landlords. In terms of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, the national median LTV ratio, which includes all counties and cities, is used to mask the staggering urban-rural gap in housing prices.<sup>57</sup> The fact of the matter is that the public is experiencing a growing burden for both rentals and purchases, yet the State Report has not further explored housing quality and the possibility of finding houses with adequate quality under such burdens.</p></li>

### Housing Subsidies (Paragraph 219 of the <em>State Report</em>)

<ol start="203">
  <li><p>Right to housing in Taiwan is centered on ownership. Taiwan’s housing policies are geared towards assisting the public to satisfy their needs for buying houses and purchasing property (e.g., public housing or affordable housing for sale, or interest subsidies for housing loans), and the largest group that receives these subsidies is the middle class. Due to improper speculation in Taiwan’s housing market, house prices have doubled or even tripled over the past decade. However, wages for Taiwan’s youth has stagnated since the 1990s. Consequently, most wage workers find it difficult to buy houses. Even if wage workers decided to buy houses, they would have to bear excessive loan terms that may even reach 30 years. As a result, the higher housing prices are, the more subsidies the government provides, which then leads to unaffordable housing and even higher housing prices.</p></li>

  <li><p>As housing prices continue to skyrocket, the effectiveness of subsidies begins to dwindle. Following the efforts of civil groups, the scope of rental subsidies was expanded in 2015 and now cover 50,000 households. Nevertheless, rental subsidies have the following problems:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>An over demand; the demands for rental subsidies significantly exceed the actual number of subsidized households.</p></li>

      <li><p>An incomprehensive rental market; in particular, low-income households often live in illegal houses, which are not applicable to subsidization, resulting in the most economically disadvantaged groups being excluded from receiving subsidies</p></li>

      <li><p>Receiving rental subsidies does not guaranty housing quality, because the subsidizing criteria only require applicants to live in legal houses and fails to understand the condition or quality of the houses.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Rental Policies

<ol start="205">
  <li><p>Taiwan’s housing development has always been centered on housing purchases/sales. With the traditional concept that equates owning property with wealth coupled with speculative investments, the majority of the public prefers to buy houses as a means of satisfying their housing demands.</p></li>

  <li><p>The supply side of Taiwan’s rental market has the following six characteristics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Houses are owned by independent landlords, who manage these houses in person and without pay; thus, overly dispersed management results in an insufficient business scale.</p></li>

      <li><p>Tax evasion or a failure to register houses that have been leased have become commonalities among landlords. The rental side of the housing market is thus becoming increasingly illegal, housing quality is inconsistent, and product information is often incorrect or not properly disclosed.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government has not stepped in and managed the prevalent rooftop additions and illegal partitions, which results in poor quality housing and safety concerns.</p></li>

      <li><p>Rentals only account for a small part of the housing market at 10.9%.</p></li>

      <li><p>The return on investment for rentals is low. That for Taipei City is merely 1.57% (owners lower costs and subsequently make up for the difference through self-maintenance, tax evasion, and jerry-building).</p></li>

      <li><p>The public’s right to housing is not adequately protected. Relevant laws and regulations are scattered in the Civil Code and the Land Act, contractual rights and obligations are ambiguous, and the processes for dispute resolutions are complex and time-consuming, which result in hesitation for both the leasing and renting party.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>The size, demands, and current condition of Taiwan’s rental market remains unknown due to a lack of statistical surveys. Consensus is that tenants in Taiwan are extremely under protected; thus, economically- and socially disadvantaged families, students, and the young working class account for a majority of the renting population. Young people set purchasing as a goal and renting as a temporary solution, and thus are willing to tolerate low housing quality and a lack of protection of their rights. On the other hand, tenants who are economically- or socially-disadvantaged have no other option than to rent. Despite this fact, they often face discrimination or rejection from landlords or are forced to relocate to houses with substandard quality or safety concerns due to rent increases. As a result, the economically- and socially-disadvantaged often have to relocate repeatedly.</p></li>

  <li><p>Taiwan’s price to income ratio has been among the highest in the world for many years,<sup>58</sup> and most individuals find housing in Taiwan unaffordable. Despite this leading to an increased rental demand, the government has been unwilling to proactively formulate rental policies. In 2015, a series of scams involving an unethical landlord, Shu-Jing Zhang, gained widespread media coverage. More than 100 former tenants were victims scammed by Zhang. Finally, the government launched measures of reform under significant public pressure. The Department of Land Administration, Ministry of the Interior subsequently proposed the Standard Contracts for Residential Lease Agreement and the Mandatory and Prohibitory Provisions of the Residential Lease.</p></li>

  <li><p>Expanding and empowering the rental market are important focuses for future reforms. First, a tax reform is necessary for increasing rentals and creating a more transparent rental environment, because Taiwan currently has a large number of vacant houses that are owned by independent landlords who evade taxes. Developments in the rental industry should be focused on elevating service standards and achieving greater transparency. Second, the rights and obligations of both the landlord and tenant should be clearly defined in a set of regulations, and effective intermediary mechanisms should be established for rental disputes, thereby elevating housing quality and rental rights. However, Taiwan’s rental market has many flaws that have accumulated over the years because of the absence of a proper system. Therefore, change in the current rental culture requires an overall review of current laws, amendments to existing laws, or establishing laws that are specifically for housing rentals, thereby securing a foundation for developing the rental market.</p></li>

  <li><p>Overall suggestions for housing legislation and policies:</p>

  <p>According to General Comment No. 4 of the ICESCR, Right to Adequate Housing, we propose the following five dimensions of policy reform and legislative suggestions:</p>

### II. The Passive Protection of Right to Housing: Prohibiting Forced Evictions

### Problems Regarding the Implementation of the ICESCR’s Regulations on Prohibiting Forced Evictions

<ol start="211">
  <li><p>Problems Regarding Domesticalization and Judicial Practice</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Taiwan domesticalized the ICESCR’s regulations on right to housing through the fragmented discussions of laws and regulations. Thus, the domesticalized laws are only effective in principle, and little remedies are provided to citizens whose right to housing are violated. Using Huaguang Community’s civil case as an example, the court was not aware of the right to housing and particularly unaware of using the ICESCR’s right to housing as a basis for administrative judgment;<sup>59</sup> thus, residents of informal settlements who were forced to evict were perceived to have no cause of action in a lawsuit. The court’s comments on the 1st Resolution of the Judge-Council in August 2014 directly limited the ICESCR’s Paragraph 13 and Paragraph 15 under General Comment No.7, which emphasizes the possibility of remedies. Furthermore, the court continues to assert property rights as the only core form of protection for right to housing.<sup>60</sup></p></li>

      <li><p>We believe that the domesticalization and judicial practice of the right to housing violates the spirit of Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 10 under General Comment No. 3 of the ICESCR (please refer to Paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 3) as well as that of General Comment No. 4 and Paragraph 13 and Paragraph 15 of General Comment No. 7. As a result, Taiwan’s legal system is incomprehensive<sup>61</sup> regarding the prevention of evictions, and people are helpless when being forced to evict.</p></li>

      <li><p>According to expert concluding observations, Taiwan must take immediate action in achieving the core obligations detailed in the ICESCR, that is, States must employ appropriate legislative measures and judicial remedies to fulfill the core obligations of ensuring the right to housing, prohibit forced evictions, and provide a definitive basis for the judicial right to defend and cause of action for people who are forced to evict.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>Problems Regarding the Implementation of Concluding Observations</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The Preliminary Response Meeting by Various Authorities on Concluding Observations and Recommendations held in June 2013 reached a resolution regarding Concluding Observations No. 47 to No. 51. The resolution specifically requested the Ministry of the Interior to hold formal hearings on laws and regulations related to forced evictions, or on various forced eviction cases (e.g., Huaguang Community, Shaoxing Community, the Dapu Incident, Miaoli’s Qiding Industrial Park, Phase 2 Development Project of Danhai New Town, the expropriation of land around Taoyuan International Airport MRT A7 station, and the expropriation case of the underground railway project in Tainan) and to postpone the demolishment of land objects for specific cases or requests stemming from unjust enrichment. However, as of June 2016, the Ministry of the Interior has not held relevant meetings. Soon after the preliminary response meeting, the government forcefully demolished four residences in Dapu, Miaoli, in July 2013, which subsequently led to one of the residents committing suicide. In August 2013, the government demolished Huaguang Community. The government also plans on recovering the residents’ unjust earnings with no intention to postpone.</p></li>

      <li><p>We believe that the Concluding Observations regarding the right to housing have not been practiced, which violates the ideology of Concluding Observations No. 7 and No. 13, which require the government to follow the content of the concluding observations and conduct reviews in a specific timeframe to fulfill its obligations as stated by the ICESCR. In addition, the government’s failure to comply violates Article 3, Article 4, and Article 6 of the Act to Implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which is detrimental to the fundamental functions of the human rights reports system.</p></li>

      <li><p>According to expert concluding observations, the government should review the implementation of concluding observations in the former human rights report, provide remedies for extant damage, and implement previous concluding observations during a specific timeframe.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>Problems Regarding the Translation of General Comments</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The MOJ’s Chinese translation of the general comments involving the right to housing is problematic. Although the translated content was edited in Taiwan, the translation by the MOJ included errors stemming from the simplified Chinese version published by the UN. The mistranslation of key messages may affect the reader’s interpretation of the ICESCR’s ideology or even diminish Taiwan’s responsibilities in practicing the right to housing.</p></li>

      <li><p>The MOJ’s critical mistranslations cause confusion in the applicability of the two covenants. For example, Paragraph 8(A) of General Comment No. 4 states that “all persons should <u>possess a degree of security of tenure</u> which guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other threats.” The underlined part of this sentence was mistranslated in the Chinese version as “procedural security of easement,” which only entails procedural security. As a result, the President of the Executive Yuan quoted the mistranslation and publicly announced that residents of informal settlements do not have the right to housing. Paragraph 16 of General Comment No. 7 states that “…must take all appropriate measures, to the maximum of its available resources, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement or access to productive land, <u>as the case may be</u>, is available.” The underscored section was mistranslated in the Chinese version as “take into consideration the circumstances (or use its discretion to decide whether),” which has become an excuse for the government for not fulfilling its responsibility of ensuring adequate housing for all households. In certain cases that involve informal settlements, the government only "takes into consideration the circumstances" when vacancies are available in public housing units. As a result, the government houses a small number of low-income households for a short period rather than taking all appropriate measures to the maximum of its available resources to ensure the availability of adequate housing as the case may be. Four similar mistranslations can be found in General Comment No. 4 and General Comment No. 7.</p></li>

      <li><p>According to expert concluding observations, the government should reference translations by the private sector<sup>62</sup> and amend the Chinese version of the General Comments.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### III. Forced Eviction Due to Development

### General Expropriation and Zone Expropriation

<ol start="214">
  <li><p>Many controversies arise from land expropriations, primarily because of a violation of the principle of proportionality and a lack of procedural justice. Regulations on public interest purpose and necessity of expropriation in the Land Expropriation Act are vague and lack concrete evaluation standards. The expropriation procedure is partially conducted by government agencies that need land, and expropriated households are often only aware of the fact during the expropriation process. At this point, public hearings held by the government are mere formalities. Although the people may voice their objections in the public hearings, these objections do not have practical influences on relevant policies. In certain cases, such as the Danhai New Town Development Project, central authorities have deliberately manipulated and distorted public opinion. The specific deficiencies of the <em>State Report on ICCPR an ICESCR</em> are detailed as follows:</p></li>

  <li><p><h3>Compensations are not Based on Current Market Value (Paragraph 221 of the <em>State Report</em>)</h3></p>

  <p>The Act mandates that the value of expropriated land shall be compensated based on its current market value.<sup>63</sup> Compensations are generally determined by the Land Value Evaluation Committee after government agencies that need land employ appraisers to assess the land value; however, the committee lacks professionalism and time, and relevant reports and processes are not transparent.</p></li>

  <li><p><h3>Problems Regarding Zone Expropriation (Paragraph 222 of the <em>State Report</em>)</h3></p>

  <p>Zone expropriation is generally used by the government as a means of acquiring large pieces of land for urban development plans. The design of this system enables the government to acquire public land that is for sale and reduces the cost of acquiring land for public facilities. Thus, the government has financial incentives to frequently launch zone expropriations, which results in large forced evictions. As of the end of June 2010, 87 zones have been expropriated, which amounts to an area of 7,288 hectares. The primary problems of zone expropriation are stated as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><h3>The mechanism for calculating right value forces landowners to leave the expropriated land:</h3></p>

      <p>In contrast to Paragraph 221-1 and Paragraph 222-3 in the State Report, the zone expropriation system uses non-transparent right value calculations as a basis for allocating land to the original landowner. Furthermore, land appreciation that follows zone expropriation often obstructs many original landowners who held smaller pieces of land from receiving allocated land and are thus forced to receive monetary compensations instead.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>In zone expropriations, low-income households and informal settlements are excluded:</h3></p>

      <p>In contrast to Paragraph 222-3 of the State Report, the price difference for resettling in affordable housing projects within zone expropriations is unaffordable for most middle- to low-income households dwelling within the expropriated zone. Furthermore, the government fails to fulfill its obligation of resettling residents of informal settlements. In practice, middle- to low-income households and residents of informal settlements usually only receive monetary compensation.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Excessive zone expropriation:</h3></p>

      <p>Taiwan has an excessive amount of land designated for urban planning. In 2011, the Control Yuan corrected the Ministry of the Interior, which is the competent authority for urban planning, and state that there is a difference of six million between the forecasted population for urban planning and Taiwan’s actual population, which indicates a severe oversupply of urban planning. However, government agencies on various levels continue to prepare for large forced evictions on the grounds of developing new urban projects, such as the Danhai New Town Development Project and Taoyuan Aerotropolis Project.</p></li>

  <li><p>Expropriation for the Purpose of Building Industrial Parks (Paragraphs 230 and 232 of the <em>State Report</em>)</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>According to the selection procedure, as stated in Article 33 of the Statute for Industrial Innovation, joint selections are only to be held by competent authorities, public and private businesses, and business persons responsible for building on the expropriated land. The owner of the land selected for expropriation cannot participate in the selection process. A feasibility report is drafted after land is selected; however, no regulations require the inclusion of stakeholders’ opinions as reference in the feasibility report. The so-called public hearing lacks regulations and thus is more of a briefing session held by government agencies that need land. Stakeholders’ petitions have no binding power, which severely violates stakeholders’ right to procedural participation.</p></li>

      <li><p>Concerning the principle of proportionality, although the Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed local governments to confirm industry demand, local governments are often insincere in their investigations and claim the existence of industry demand based solely on manufacturers’ surveys without confirming whether manufacturers are truly planning to build or expand plants. As manufacturers’ demands are mistakenly treated as industry demand, lowly-developed and unnecessary construction projects have sprouted around Taiwan. For example, 631 hectares of land were expropriated for the 4th phase of the Central Taiwan Science Park Development Project, which resulted in the disintegration of the local community and the displacement of residents. After the residents had been forced to evict, the manufacturers broke their promise of moving into the new site, and legal proceedings are ongoing to this day.<sup>64</sup></p></li>

  <li><p><h3>An Overview of Individual Cases that Violated the Two Covenants</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><h3>Danhai New Town Development Project (Paragraph 229 of the <em>State Report</em>)</h3></p>

      <p>A briefing session was held by the Ministry of the Interior. However, government officials gathered citizens who supported the project and rehearsed the briefing, in which opposing citizens were pictured as the enemy. In addition, the Ministry of the Interior also contracted a survey company to directly request residents to write down what they agreed with on the survey.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Zone Expropriation of the Taoyuan Aerotropolis Project (Paragraphs 233, 234, and 235 of the <em>State Report</em></h3></p>

      <p>The Taoyuan Aerotropolis Project expected to expropriate 3,155 hectares of land, which affects more than 30,000 people. However, stakeholders had no opportunity to participate fully in decision-making prior to July 2014, which is when the content of the project was approved. The government held a hearing in May 2016. However, the nature of the hearing failed to achieve the basic requirement of genuine consultation, because no conclusions were made, and the debated content was not binding towards the Land Expropriation Deliberation Team. To resolve this problem, the Ministry of the Interior should immediately amend Paragraph 3, Article 11-1 of the Enforcement Rules of the Land Expropriation Act. In addition, building temporary housing areas (THA) prior to demolishing buildings is not applicable to all legal buildings within the expropriation range (e.g., Hongjhu Village, which was designated as a THA). Furthermore, the government does not guarantee adequate housing for economically disadvantaged households and tenants within the project.<sup>65</sup></p></li>

      <li><p><h3>The Expropriation Case of the Underground Railway Project in Tainan (Paragraphs 236 and 237 of the <em>State Report</em>)</h3></p>

      <p>Approved by the Executive Yuan in 2009, this project plans to build an underground railway beneath existing housing. Approximately 5.4 hectares of land and 323 households are to be expropriated. However, the government did not seek stakeholders’ opinions when formulating the project, and intentionally avoided certain protesting residents during communications. During the public hearing, a large number of police officers and staff limited the residents’ speech, and the government continuously refused to hold hearings according to Article 107 of the Administrative Procedure Act. In addition, the government did not carefully consider alternative projects, such as substituting expropriation for requisition. Although the government provided substitute housing for expropriated households to purchase, the prices of the substitute housing were higher than that of the expropriated houses, and the life functions of the substitute housing were significantly inferior to that of the expropriated land.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p><h3>Suggestions</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><h3>Abolish the Zone Expropriation System</h3></p>

      <p>Zone expropriation often involves development plans that require a large amount of land. Taiwan currently exhibits a severe oversupply of industrial land and land for urban planning; thus, the zone expropriation system is redundant. If not abolished, the system will lead to numerous large-scale forced evictions due to unnecessary land development plans proposed by the government.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Prohibit the Expropriation of Special Agricultural Districts:</h3></p>

      <p>Special agricultural districts are excellent farmland designated and protected by competent authorities. As food safety has become an issue of national concern, the expropriation of special agricultural districts should be prohibited.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Practice Purchase Price Agreement:</h3></p>

      <p>To reinstitute fair price negotiations and to only use expropriation as a last resort, specific regulations should be stipulated to require genuine consultation between parties that need the land and owners, and expropriation is prohibited unless this criterion is met.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Enhance Public Interest Purpose and Necessity Evaluations:</h3></p>

      <p>Land expropriation refers to a government executing its public power and forcefully expropriating land that belongs to the people. Thus, the government must stipulate specific standards for determining public interest purpose and necessity, which are used to examine the legality and legitimacy of agencies that need land depriving the people of their right to property as protected by the constitution.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Enhance the Deliberation Mechanism:</h3></p>

      <p>The original deliberation mechanism of the Land Expropriation Act is overly simple. Detailed reasons for the approval of expropriations should be specified. Central authorities should establish a land expropriation deliberation committee with citizens comprising two-thirds of the members. Furthermore, the members should be recommended by public/private schools and NGOs, and include professionals in agriculture and Indigenous culture. The committee should have the right to approve, the right to reduce the expropriation range, and the right to discretionarily increase the amount of subsidies.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Ratify the Hearing System:</h3></p>

      <p>Currently, public hearings are held in cases of land expropriation. However, public hearings have low efficiency and a lenient due process. Often, agencies that need land deliberately create obstacles in the process. Thus, based on the Administrative Procedure Act, we request the establishment of comprehensive hearing procedures for land expropriations, which deprive people’s right of property, thereby highlighting Taiwan’s emphasis on the rule of law.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Practice Complete Compensation:</h3></p>

      <p>Currently, compensation for expropriation is only applicable to structures above land and the land itself. However, residents’ emotions and survival conditions are severely damaged after the loss of land and houses. Thus, additional laws on complete compensation should be ratified, thereby providing comprehensive protection of the rights of expropriated households.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Urban Land Consolidation

<ol start="220">
  <li><p>Urban land consolidation is an important comprehensive development method used in urban planning in Taiwan, and is often used for constructing new areas or renewing old areas within extant urban plans. In recent years, large areas of urban land consolidation projects have been conducted, which has led to many controversies regarding right to housing. However, these controversies have not been mentioned in the State Report. Urban land consolidation deprives people’s right to housing, employment rights, and right to property. However, the procedural protection (proper due process) and practical protection (resettlement measures) for those affected by urban land consolidation are severely insufficient. Urban land consolidation can be further classified as public urban land consolidation and private urban land consolidation, which respectively violate right to housing in the following aspects:</p></li>

  <li><p>Owners’ and residents’ consent are not required for public urban land consolidation, which only requires the approval of competent authorities. In practice, this approach is similar to zone expropriation. The only difference is that residents receive a higher proportion of allocated land. Nevertheless, the procedural protection for public urban land consolidation is significantly insufficient. Aside from a civil participation system mandated in the urban planning procedure, no civil participation system exists in the process of urban land consolidation, and citizens are unable to examine the public interest purpose and necessity of the consolidation through proper due process. The threshold for civil objections is extremely high, yet the people have no voting power. In addition, public urban land consolidation plans lack resettlement measures. The limitation of minimum lot size excludes small landowners within the project from receiving allocated land and further deprives the right to housing of residents without property rights.</p></li>

  <li><p>Currently, relevant laws mandate that private urban land consolidation projects shall be approved by more than half of the landowners who own among themselves over half of the total area of the lands,which is equivalent to depriving the right to property and right to housing of objecting households upon majority vote. Similar to public urban land consolidation projects, resettlement plans or reconstruction plans for structures above land are not mandatory for private urban land consolidation projects. Under the limited legal framework, the consolidation committee (and its general assembly and board meeting) can determine the course of consolidation based on the assembly regulations and resolutions. Similarly, resolutions are reached based on the majority vote, which excludes affected parties from practical procedural protection. Although competent authorities are accountable for approving or rejecting relevant projects, disputes that arise during the process are often perceived as private right disputes between the consolidation committee and the plaintiff. As a result, objecting residents who are at a social and economic disadvantage often bear the burden of proof in the litigation process.</p></li>

  <li><p>Overall, we believe that Taiwan’s urban land consolidation system violates General Comments No. 4 of the ICESCR, which mandates “the right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference,” “individuals, as well as families, are entitled to adequate housing regardless of age, economic status, group or other affiliation or status and other such factors,” and “conferring legal security of tenure.” Furthermore, the system also violates General Comments No. 7 of the ICESCR, which require “an opportunity for genuine consultation with those affected,” “the State party must take all appropriate measures, to the maximum of its available resources, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement or access to productive land, as the case may be, is available,” “guarantee legal protection,” “provision of legal remedies,” and “provision, where possible, of legal aid to persons who are in need of it to seek redress from the courts.”</p></li>

  <li><p>Suggestions</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The government should gather personal information on residents who have been forced to evict or who will be forcefully evicted due to urban land consolidation projects, and stipulate policies on resettling residents who have been forcefully evicted, and prevent future evictions from occurring.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should review and amend regulations on private urban land consolidation that allow the deprivation of residents’ rights based on majority votes and examine unequal and inefficient deficiencies.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should review and amend deficiencies in the due process of public interest purpose and necessity of consolidation projects.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should review urban land consolidation and amend relevant laws, enhance information transparency and genuine counseling mechanisms for public participation, reinforce the protection of right to housing for small landowners or residents without property rights, and prohibit forced evictions in urban land consolidation projects.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Urban Renewal

<ol start="225">
  <li><p>The public interest purpose mentioned in Paragraph 223 of the State Report is an expectation rather than a reflection of the current system. The current urban renewal system emphasizes a continuous increase in building volume and lacks a comprehensive planning vision, which often leads to and overdevelopment of urban spaces. This, in turn, damages ecological resilience and makes cities vulnerable to major disasters, which contradicts the concept of public interest purpose.<sup>67</sup> In addition, urban renewal that is volume-oriented provides incentives for the enforcers of urban renewal to force residents to evict. Practical problems are described as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><h3>Insufficient Public Participation Mechanisms in Urban Renewal Projects</h3></p>

      <p>Currently, the public can only participate in public hearings and hearings held after projects have been approved. Due to incomprehensive laws, the latter is identical to public hearings, which are essentially one-way policy announcements. As a result, residents who feel that their rights have been violated cannot effectively object, not to mention influence the content of the project.<sup>68</sup> This is a violation of the ICESCR’s General Comment No. 12.<sup>69</sup></p></li>

      <li><p><h3>The Rights Transformation Mechanism Forces Current Residents to Leave Their Houses</h3></p>

      <p>Article 31 of the Urban Renewal Act states that the rights transformation value shall be used as the criterion for exchange before and after renewal. However, appraisals are conducted by the executor of the project, which indicates a lack of information transparency. Additionally, the land value after renewal will exceed that of before renewal. Thus, residents are often burdened with mortgages that are millions of NTD and eventually displaced even after retrieving compensation for urban renewal. This is a violation of Paragraph 3, Article 2 of the ICCPR and Paragraph 13, General Comment No. 7 of the ICESCR.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Informal Settlements in Areas Designated for Urban Renewal are Not Protected</h3></p>

      <p>Contradictory to descriptions in the State Report, the current urban renewal system does not specify that the executors of urban renewal projects are obligated to resettle residents of informal settlements. The current system requires executors to propose resettlement plans; however, in practice, these residents usually only receive monetary compensation. In certain cases, executors have used civil suites to forcefully evict residents of informal settlements prior to proposing a resettlement plan and to request the return of unjust enrichments, which is a clear violation of Paragraph 8, General Comment No. 4 and Paragraph 8 and Paragraph 9, General Comment No. 7 of the ICESCR.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p><h3>Suggestions</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Suspend all forceful demolitions that pose no immediate public danger in urban renewal projects.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should withdraw all civil suits that involve informal settlements in urban renewal cases founded on claims of demolishing buildings and returning land and unjust enrichments.</p></li>

      <li><p>Abolish the current Urban Renewal Act. After having comprehensive discussions with the people and civil groups on renewal policies, stipulate relevant laws with the premise of not violating the Two Covenants. Relevant laws should provide adequate right to housing that protects tenants, households in informal settlements, and other affected parties.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### IV. Residents without Property Rights and Those that are Susceptible to Violations

### Informal Settlements

<ol start="227">
  <li><p>According to government statistics, there are at least 37,794 informal settlements that formed prior to 1963 due to historical reasons.<sup>70</sup> The State Report failed to mention any problems related to informal settlements. However, in many major development plans (e.g., urban renewal, land expropriation, and urban land consolidation), residents of informal settlements are not legally recognized as stakeholders. Thus, no systematic channel of participation is provided for these residents. This leaves them susceptible to forced evictions, which is a severe violation of General Comment No. 4 and General Comment No. 7 of the ICESCR. Without conducting any genuine consultation, administrative agencies have quoted the Principles for the Disposal of Occupied National Public Use Real-Estate Managed by Administrative Authorities, the Disposal Guidelines for Occupation of State-Owned Real Estate not in Public Use, and regulations on local government-owned property management and autonomy to file civil suits against residents without property rights who are living on public land. Administrative agencies have further requested the demolishment of buildings and the return of land and unjust enrichments while the residents cannot claim any legal protection. Numerous cases have occurred in Taiwan, some involving the government previously making oral commitments and guaranteeing to settle residents, such as the Toad Mountain Community Case, Wolong Street Case, Huaguang Community Case, Shaoxing Community Case, and Liu’s Family Case in Sanxia. In other cases, residents were forced to sign rental contracts with the government and continue to dwell in areas designated for development plants. These contracts stated that the leasing agency can terminate the contract anytime for reasons of development without giving tenants any compensation or resettlement assistance, such as the Guishan Dahu Private Urban Land Consolidation Project.</p></li>

  <li><p><h3>An Overview of Individual Cases that Violated the Two Covenants</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><h3>The Liu’s Family Case in Longpu Village, Sanxia</h3></p>

      <p>The Liu family has dwelled by Sanxia River since the Qing Dynasty. The family farms for a living, and currently includes more than 30 family members. The working age men in the family work as farmers and are all illiterate. In 1977, the Liu family missed the opportunity to register their land and acquire property right. In late 2013, the Liu family received a demolition notice, which required the family to return the land and unjust enrichments.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>The Huaguang Community Case</h3></p>

      <p>For further details, please refer to the <em>Review of the Initial Reports of the Government of Taiwan on the Implementation of the International Human Rights Covenants</em>.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>The Shaoxing Community Case</h3></p>

      <p>For further details, please refer to the <em>Review of the Initial Reports of the Government of Taiwan on the Implementation of the International Human Rights Covenants</em>.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>The Guishan Dahu Private Urban Land Consolidation Project</h3></p>

      <p>The Dahu Private Urban Land Consolidation Project covers seven hectares of land in Guishan District, Taoyuan City. The consolidation committee sent demolition notices to the residents in late 2014. Currently, residents dwelling in several informal settlements have been forcefully evicted, yet ten households in informal settlements and ten households that rented public land remain on site. The residents were unable to take part in the decision-making process of the project (please refer to the aforementioned details on urban land consolidation), and were accused of being greedy when asking for reasonable compensation. The residents repeatedly petitioned for the city government to redefine the boundaries of the project in vain. Currently, there are no laws that protect these residents’ right to adequate housing, and forceful eviction is a highly likely outcome.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>The Toad Mountain Community</h3></p>

      <p>With more than 60 households, the land rights in this case are complex. In 1999, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology signed a Resident Resettlement Agreement. On December 24, 1999, the Urban Planning Commission, Taipei City Government held a project meeting and reached the solution of "development can only occur after resettlement has been completed." However, the government’s policies changed in 2000, the construction of public housing ceased, and land designated for resettlements was withdrawn. In 2014, the entire site was designated as a cultural landscape by the Department of Cultural Affairs, yet National Taiwan University of Science and Technology filed a lawsuit against some of the residents on claims of demolishing buildings and returning land (A46) and unjust enrichments.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p><h3>Suggestions</h3></p>

  <p>The government of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) has not used appropriate means to practice the protection of rights as stated in Paragraph 1, Article 2 of the ICESCR. Rather, the government uses rash administrative rules, such as “based on the government’s need” as a basis for forced evictions, which opposes the ideology of the ICESCR. To improve this situation, we request the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Suspend all current litigation procedures related to forceful evictions: Provide affordable housing for all forcefully evicted households.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should immediately conduct a comprehensive investigation on the distribution, location and number of houses concerning informal settlements, and reference the structure of the Spatial Planning Act to stipulate corresponding laws on improving the housing environment and protecting the right to housing.</p></li>

      <li><p>Review the National Property Act, the Principles for the Disposal of Occupied National Public Use Real-Estate Managed by Administrative Authorities, the Disposal Guidelines for Occupation of State-Owned Real Estate not in Public Use, and other regulations on local government-owned property management and autonomy that cause forceful evictions, and stipulate adequate laws and regulations based on the previous point to protect the right to housing.</p></li>

      <li><p>Stipulate security of tenure in the Civil Code to ensure that all citizens have the basic right to adequate housing.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### The Homeless

<ol start="230">
  <li><p>The State Report Failed to Mention Policies Regarding the Homeless; Policies Should Be Focused on the Four Following Issues:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><h3>There is a Severe Shortage in Taiwan’s Homeless Shelters and a Lack of Diverse Counseling Mechanisms</h3></p>

      <p>The government responded to Point 162 of the Concluding Observations for the State Report and stated that from January 2015 to September 2015, a total of 2,644 people in Taiwan were registered as homeless. The Ministry of Interior entrusted Professor Li-Zen Zheng and Professor Wan-Yi Lin from Department of Social Work, National Taiwan University to conduct a research, which indicated that the ten homeless shelters in eight counties/cities in Taiwan with the largest homeless populations had a total of 340 beds for recurring accommodation. The maximum capacity was 415 beds, which indicates a severe shortage. In addition, homeless shelters in Taiwan primarily provide accommodation, yet lack comprehensive plans that involve tiered services.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Using the Household Registration System to Limit Welfare Services and the Provision of Resources</h3></p>

      <p>Many county/city governments only provide emergency resources and services or short-term settlement services when personal safety concerns arise for homeless people that are not registered in that particular county/city. For other welfare resources, county/city governments request the homeless to return to the county/city that they are registered under, which will provide assistance to the homeless. Certain counties/cities even send the homeless from their jurisdiction to other countries/cities to reduce the stress caused by an increase in services and resources for the homeless and show no willingness or action in providing counsel to the homeless.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>Evicting the Homeless</h3></p>

      <p>The homeless have no location to store their personal objects, which affects their work and daily lives. Currently, the government only provides two storage facilities, which is a severe under supply. In recent years, the government has treated the homeless without dignity for the reason of environmental protection. In 2015, numerous scandals erupted, where the homeless were evicted and their personal items repeatedly removed, which eventually lead to the homeless committing suicide.</p></li>

      <li><p><h3>The Homeless Face Obstacles in the Rental Market</h3></p>

      <p>In 2016, the government responded to Point 163-3 of the Concluding Observations for the State Report, which details life-rebuilding services, and stated that the homeless must list their rental address as their household registration address to apply for rental subsidies. When the homeless seek houses for rent, they often face obstacles such as expensive rent, rejection from landlords, and an excessive distance between the house for rent and their work location, which obstruct the homeless from successfully renting houses.</p></li>

  <li><p><h3>Suggestions</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The central government should be responsible for establishing a national homeless integration project and transcend the welfare localism that is based on the household registration system.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should stipulate policies that prioritize housing for the disadvantaged and establish long-term settlement services and measures that fulfill the needs of the homeless. Furthermore, the government should establish timetables, raise finances, and conduct performance evaluations. Obstacles that prevent the homeless from receiving housing resources as subjects of social housing in the Housing Act should also be eliminated. The Housing Act should be in line with regulations on providing counsel and services to the homeless, and supplementary measures should be established to fulfill the homeless’ short-, mid-, and long-term housing demands.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should provide employment opportunities, and provide life-rebuilding measures such as employment support, medical care, and psychological health care.</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should prohibit evicting the homeless or reporting them to the police, and proactively provide public services that fulfill the practical needs of the homeless in terms of housing.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Other Groups Susceptible to Violations

<ol start="232">
  <li><p><h3>Tenants</h3></p>

  <p>The current housing system exposes tenants to various forms of forced evictions. For example, in cases of forced evictions caused directly by development, tenants generally are not given alternative housing or compensation, and the government has not conducted surveys or collected statistics on the persons or groups with affected security of tenure. Article 37 of the Urban Renewal Act states that for leased lands and buildings within the urban renewal area, the tenant can request compensation equivalent to two months of rent. [A49] However, tenants still have to move, and the compensation is insufficient for the tenants to relocate back to their original house after the urban renewal project has been completed. Additionally, resettlement measures such as leasing priority are not offered, which results in tenants being unable to rent houses in their areas of choice. Furthermore, gentrification in cases of indirect forced evictions caused by urban renewal, land expropriation, and urban land consolidation causes tenants living in adjacent areas to relocate unwillingly because of rising house prices. These conditions violate General Comment No. 4 and General Comment No. 7 of the ICESCR.</p></li>

  <li><p><h3>The Losheng Sanatorium Case</h3></p>

  <li><p>Losheng Sanatorium, founded in 1930, is located in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei City. In the past, the government used Losheng Sanatorium to quarantine people with leprosy. Losheng Sanatorium was Taiwan’s only leper colony, but over the years, the residents have come to see Losheng Sanatorium as a home and a place where they wish to spend the rest of their lives.<sup>72</sup> However, Losheng Sanatorium was designated as a machine room by the Department of Rapid Transit Systems, Taipei City Government in 1994, and construction commenced in 2002. The tenants have protested for 11 years. Currently, the 140 remaining residents face a construction project with safety concerns on a daily basis. Practical errors in site selection,<sup>73</sup> an absence of communications during the site selection process, and forcing the residents to relocate to the medical wing violate the residents’ right to adequate housing and right to health. In the Losheng Sanatorium’s preservation movement, three requests were proposed based on the right to housing: impartial safety inspections, the immediate repair of the buildings and restoration of water and electricity, and to rebuild at the original site. Nevertheless, the government’s response to the Losheng Sanatorium Case has failed to comply with the standards as stated in the Two Covenants. In the 2012 ICCPR State Report,<sup>74</sup> the government acknowledged its mistakes in the Losheng Sanatorium Case, yet employed no voluntary action to rectify these mistakes. We request the government and competent authorities to immediately respond to the requests of Losheng Sanatorium’s residents, and to resolve problems pertaining to the right to health, such as an insufficient number of caregivers<sup>75</sup> and medical facilities that do not satisfy patients’ needs.<sup>76</sup></p></li>
</ol>

### V. Other

### Tax Justice

<ol start="234">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 195 of the State Report, the ratio of income share has seemingly decreased; however, the effectiveness of decreasing the ratio of income share via transfer income (welfare subsidies) is significantly higher than that of transfer expenditure (direct tax). In 2014, the effectiveness of transfer income accounted for 89% of total redistribution, when in actuality, transfer income was only 11%. This indicates that the government uses transfer income to redistribute income, yet discards tax policies, which have direct effects. In 2014, Taiwan’s tax incidence was only 12.3% (less social security contribution), which is among the lowest rankings in the world. However, welfare subsidies are mainly provided in cash, which is easily canceled by an increase in commodity prices. As a result, aggregate expenditure exhibits an increase, yet improvements in living conditions are limited.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government’s method of increasing expenditure and reducing income to achieve income redistribution causes further fiscal strain. Since 2007, the central government’s average annual debt has reached NTD $322.5 billion, which accounts for 12% to 16% of the government’s total budget. Thus, the government’s claim of effective income redistribution is in fact achieved by using resources designated for future generations.</p></li>

  <li><p>We propose the following suggestions for stipulating practical policies: The effectiveness of tax policies must first be improved to achieve comprehensive income distribution. Equity transactions, property transactions, and rent income should be taxed for capital gains tax. The partial deduction of the integrated income tax system, where corporate income tax can be used to offset income tax, should be discontinued.</p></li>
</ol>

### Tax Deductions for the Disadvantaged

<ol start="237">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 196 of the State Report, elevating tax deductions does not reduce, but rather increases the wealth gap. Taiwan has a lenient tax system, thus, the economically disadvantaged and the working class have low tax burdens. However, increasing tax deductions under a progressive tax rate system benefits the rich and further widens the wealth gap. Although Taiwan’s Tax Income Act offers deductions or exemptions for all types of income, different types of income are offered with significantly different deductions. For example, savings income and dividend income receive far higher deductions than other types of income. Currently, the Tax Income Act provides a special deduction of up to NTD $270,000 for savings and investments, which is significantly higher than the deduction of NTD $128,000 for wage income. In addition, although the integrated income tax system replaced full imputation with partial imputation, those who hold a large number of shares remain to receive the benefit of large tax deductions, which benefits capital gains and results in unfair taxations.</p></li>

  <li><p>We propose the following suggestions for stipulating practical policies: Limit and reduce deduction measures for all types of income tax, thereby expanding the tax base and tax sources, investing tax income on public services and care policies for the disadvantaged, and creating a comprehensive social security network.</p></li>
</ol>

### Commodity Tax

<ol start="239">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 197 of the State Report, the government has always perceived commodity tax as a tool for saving the economy. The government anticipates that employing tax reductions or exemptions will increase consumption. However, a reduction in commodity tax for imports is not guaranteed to be reflected in cost. As a result, the end consumption price remains constant after commodity tax is reduced, and tax deductions only benefit importers. The Commodity Tax Act was amended in 2015, exempting wheelchair accessible vehicles from commodity tax purchased within five years of the date of amendment. Although this amendment reduced the prices of wheelchair accessible vehicles, only a small portion of economically stable people with disabilities were beneficiaries. In practice, this amendment did not benefit the disabled who were economically disadvantaged, who remained unable to afforded wheelchair accessible vehicles.</p></li>

  <li><p>We propose the following suggestions for stipulating practical policies: As commodity tax deductions and exemptions do not benefit those who are disabled and also have an economic disadvantage, the government should maintain a reasonable tax, and use tax incomes to expand the accessible public transportation network in metropolitan areas and rural areas, thereby increasing convenience and proximity.</p></li>

  <li><p>Please refer to Paragraph 27 to Paragraph 31 in the Special Chapter on Indigenous Peoples of the Covenants Watch ICCPR Shadow Report, “In response to Paragraph 220 of the State Report,” to further understand issues pertaining to the right to housing of Indigenous people dwelling in urban areas.</p></li>

  <li>Article 34 of the Housing Act: In order to improve housing quality, central competent authorities shall establish basic housing standards based on social and economic development, public safety and health, and living requirements. Basic housing standards serve as a basis for housing policy planning and housing subsidies. The abovementioned basic living standards shall be examined and adjusted by the central competent authority every four years.</li>
  <li>For example, include rain sheds, balconies, driveways, or public spaces (with a ratio that ranges between 29.41% and 66.01%) in calculations for housing floor area.</li>
  <li>Those who rent houses that are substandard should have a higher chance of success when applying for rental subsidies. However, after receiving rental subsidies, applicants must rent houses that comply with housing standards. A great disparity exists between the market rates of the two types of housing and the difference generally exceeds the subsidized amount. Although policies that promote rent subsidies cam improve the housing standards of disadvantaged families, the affordability of housing is not properly considered.</li>
  <li>Problems include time of registration (builders only have to register after all houses are sold out or after project closure), registering general square meters rather than actual square meters, absence of information concerning clearances, and the fact that presale houses are not required to register.</li>
  <li>Housing statistics such as various housing demands (e.g., purchases/sales, rentals, and housing for the disadvantaged), environmental risks, number of vacant houses, and housing additions and alterations.</li>
  <li>The majority of Taiwan’s social housing is centered in Taipei City (91%). However, housing protection for the disadvantaged is extremely weak even in Taipei City. From 2011 to 2015, a total of 1,116 social housing units were built in Taipei City, among which 155 were reserved for those with special conditions or identities (14%), a number which is marginally higher than the 10% required by the Housing Act. This indicates that government housing policies for the disadvantaged are passive and that the volume of disadvantaged housing is underestimated. Taipei City's Jointly Developed Public Housing Project (570 housing units) rents 10% (57 housing units) to persons with special conditions or identities, and the Xinglong Public Housing Project (272 housing units) rents 30% (90 housing units) to low-income households of the former An-Kang Public Housing Project.</li>
  <li>Taipei City and New Taipei City have been gradually implementing social housing projects targeted towards applicants from 20 years of age to 45 years of age with an annual household income that is less than the 50th percentile. Loose limits on income have resulted in insufficient care for the disadvantaged.</li>
  <li>For example, New Taipei City employed a build-operate-transfer model in 2013 consigned a builder to build social housing. To profit from the project, the builder initially sold 30% of the project’s floor area as superficies right-based houses and leased 49% of the floor area at the market rate. Only 21% of floor area was leased at 80% of the market rate, which contradicts the values of social housing policies. After a series of protests from civil groups, the rental criteria were amended.</li>
  <li>According to the Housing Affordability Indicator Report published by the Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior, the LTV ratio from April to June 2015 was 67.34% for Taipei City and 54.16% for New Taipei City, which indicates significant burdens for buying houses (the public exhibits a low affordability).</li>
  <li>The price to income ratio (median of total house prices/median of household annual disposable income) of major cities around the world in the third quarter of 2015: Hong Kong (19), Sydney (12.2), Vancouver (10.8), San Francisco (9.4), London (8.5), Los Angeles (8.1), New York (5.9), and Tokyo (4.3). Taiwan's price to income ratio in 2015 was extremely high at 8.69, with the three highest cities being Taipei City (16.1), New Taipei City (12.95), and Taichung City (8.83). Data were sourced from the 12th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey (2016) and the 2015 Third Quarter Housing Statistics published by the Construction and Planning Agency, the Ministry of the Interior.</li>
  <li>The final verdict of the Huaguang Community Case: Please refer to the 2015 Supreme Administrative Court Verdict No. 543. The 1st Resolution of the Supreme Administrative Court Judge-Council in August 2014 concluded that “whether a claimant can directly pursue a cause of action against government departments is dependent on whether the content, terms, and conditions of the cause of action are clearly stipulated in the relevant regulations of the Two Covenants.” In the Huaguang Community Case, the judge asserted that the right to housing was not specifically defined in the ICESCR and thus cannot serve as a basis for cause of action. The verdict implied an affirmation of using the right to housing as a right to defend; however, as subsequent reasoning denied the basis of cause of action in this case, the validity of implementing cause of action to defend is unclear.</li>
  <li>The court’s perception, as explained above, is also apparent in J.Y. Interpretation No. 732, which asserts that freedom of residence as stated in Article 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, is a form of protection applicable to people who hold legal ownership over properties.</li>

  <li>Article 11 of the Land Expropriation Act: The term “market value” referred to in the preceding paragraph shall mean normal transaction price in the market.</li>
  <li>At the time, the government determined that AU Optronics Corp. intended to establish a plant in the park. However, AUO later retracted, and large pieces of land originally vacated for the 4th phase of the Central Taiwan Science Park Development Project remain idle. However, the Changhua government continues to plan to launch the 352-hectare Erlin Precision Machinery Industrial Park in a nearby area. This example indicates that the Ministry of Economic Affair’s instruction of “first confirming whether existing industrial land is available in the surrounding areas” has not been properly executed by local governments.</li>
  <li>The government only provides “one sum amount of housing aid, and timely and adequate welfare assistance, employment consultation, and referral to needed services and resources” to economically disadvantaged households. Please see page 8 to page 126 of the 2014 Report for Formulating Projects in Taoyuan International Airport and Adjacent Areas.</li>

  <li>In 2012, the Control Yuan conducted an investigation and found that the MRT Xinzhuang Station machine room construction project had been postponed for 88 months, and the budget had been increased by NTD $8.5 billion. Improper construction schedules led to cracks forming in the new Losheng Sanatorium building. The government's critical mistake was poor site selection. Regarding this issue, the Control Yuan corrected the New Taipei City Government, the Department of Health and Welfare, and the Department of Rapid Transit Systems, Taipei City Government.</li>

  <li>Item 3 and Item 4, Article 3 of the Act of Human Rights Protection and Compensation for Hansen's Disease Patients states that the medical rights of patients include the allocation of sufficient medical and administrative manpower, lifelong treatment and care, and rehabilitation and nursing services. However, the caregivers at Losheng Sanatorium are currently understaffed, which violates the promise stated in Item 3 of sufficient manpower. Furthermore, a shortage of caregivers also leads to a violation of rights to nursing services, as stated in Item 4.</li>
  <li>Item 3, Article 3 of the Act of Human Rights Protection and Compensation for Hansen’s Disease Patients states that the medical rights of patients include the establishment of medical facilities and equipment that meet the special physical and mental needs of Hansen’s disease patients. However, rather than making improvements and establishing needed facilities at Losheng Sanatorium, management at the sanatorium request residents who need special care or who become ill to relocate to the new medical wing.</li>

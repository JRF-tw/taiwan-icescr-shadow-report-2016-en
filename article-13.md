## Article 13 the Right to Education

### The Plight of Gender Diverse Students

<ol start="282">
  <li><p>In Sections 300 to 302 on “Equal Education Rights” from the “Second State Report on the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights”, the right to education for diverse gender students and their in-school plight was not mentioned. The statement “educational opportunities for homosexual students or those with a sexual-orientation different from their biological gender should be equally respected” was, furthermore, deleted from the draft report.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Taiwan government, since the 2013 initial country review report that barely commented on the education policy of the Ministry of Education which advocated respect for diverse genders and the eradication of discrimination and prejudice, has avoided the issue of persistent homophobia in the school environment and the very real circumstances of oppressive discrimination suffered by diverse gender (LGBTI) students. Government institutions, when coping with the frequent machinations of conservative church groups and parent associations to disrupt policies on homosexual education, sex education, and diverse family education, have been not merely passive in defense of the rights of diverse gender students, but have, moreover, retreated on all fronts in the face of such obstacles. There has even been an instance where the Ministry of Education hired a person openly opposed to both homosexual education and the spirit of gender equality as a member of the ministry’s committee on gender equality in education, interfering with the policy and promotion of gender equality.</p></li>

  <li><p>Present school environments continue to perpetrate a widespread culture of sexual discrimination and homophobia, which as a result causes students of diverse genders to frequently come under immense stress. In the past five years there has been a rising incidence of suicides amongst diverse gender students who have suffered long-term attitudes of discrimination and doubts in their relationships due to their sexual traits or orientations. The educational rights and campus life of diverse gender students have also been adversely affected by a rising incidence of sexual bullying in the form of verbal insults, prejudice, verbal attacks and harassment that have resulted in mild to severe violence. Many civic groups have been receiving increasing complaints about incidents of sexual bullying. These incidents can all be linked to rigid policies on school campuses and the discriminatory attitudes of teachers and staff. The shortcomings of educational authorities in response to “hateful homosexual discourse by teachers and in the classroom”, “compulsory dress-codes requiring skirts”, and hurtful or oppressive attitudes toward minority gender or transgender students is perhaps the most severe form of oppression now confronting the entire student body.</p></li>

  <li><p>A 2014 press release, “The Ministry of Education’s Appeal to Implement Preventive Bullying Actions on School Campuses in Response to the 'May 17th Anti-Homophobia Day',” noted that “all levels of schools should utilize all forms of activities and educational policies to actively promote the prohibition of any words or behaviors that discriminate against people of different genders, gender traits, gender identities or sexual orientations; and, moreover, actively provide support to improve the plight of those students suffering hardships due to gender, gender trait, gender identity or sexual orientation.” In order to put this advocacy into practice on school campuses, besides promoting awareness for the issue, institutionalized homophobia in schools must be investigated and rectified, educational rights and campus safety for students with non-traditional gender traits must be taken seriously, the issue of diverse gender orientations must be incorporated into gender equality education, and all members of a school must participate together in the building of an improved culture and atmosphere for all genders.</p></li>

  <li><p>In order to secure the right for all to exercise their rights, without discrimination due to their identity, and to enjoy equal rights to education is the duty of the government. In this regard the country should adopt a comprehensive and concrete policy that eliminates discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and guarantees the right to education for gender diverse students. The Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association (TGEEA) has issued the following list of demands:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Research of homosexual educational materials suitable to each level of education: primary, junior and senior high schools.</p></li>

      <li><p>Draft into the National Education Curriculum Syllabus the principles of respect for human rights, support for diversity, and elimination of discrimination, as well as the stipulation of clear specifications on the content and manner of implementation for a gender equity education syllabus.</p></li>

      <li><p>In the Ministry of Education’s “Plan to Promote Friendly Campuses”, the issue of gender diversity should be incorporated, paying attention to the right to education and the campus hardships of gender diverse students.</p></li>

      <li><p>On the job teacher training, teacher qualification training, counselor training, and community and parent education should all include subjects on the knowledge, competency and strategy of gender diversity education so as to increase respect for diversity and eliminate discrimination.</p></li>

### Work-Study Cooperative Education Students

<ol start="287">
  <li><p>Response to Paragraphs 285-286 concerning the issue of work-study cooperative students in Article 13 of the State Report. At its conception the system for cooperative education focused on technical instruction in manufacturing industries, however service sector industries have recently become mainstream participants in cooperative education. According to data from the Ministry of Education, the number and percentage of cooperative students entering service sector jobs has been greatly increasing along with the development of Taiwan’s service industries. The largest increase has been in food services which grew by 28.5% in 2008 to 33.4% in 2012; whereas a slight drop-off from 16.2% in 2008 to 14.5% was experienced by hair-care and grooming services. Transportation services made-up 6.9% and the film industry 0.4%, so that altogether service industries comprised 54.8% of cooperative student placements. Cooperative student placements in the electronics and electrical appliances industry fell from a percentage of 30.6% in 2008 to 26% in 2012, affected by the poor economic conditions of the industry as a whole in the same period. The percentage for the manufacturing industry remained stable at 18% in 2008 and 18.5% in 2012.</p></li>

  <li><p>Whether having gone through a revolving or a stage-based cooperative education program and after investing the long-period of time in learning an enterprise’s technology, students should of course be able to stay on at the facility and put into practice their learned competencies as official members of the workforce. This is after all the very raison d'etre and function of such programs. However, over the three-year period from 2009-2011 the rate of new graduates staying on at cooperative education enterprises dropped from 15.89% to 13.4%. In point of fact, the original 15% is already on the low side, but gradual decline on top of this is cause for real concern as to the future outlook.</p></li>

  <li><p>As a result Taiwan’s de-industrialization trend toward an emerging service-based economy, cooperative education, under the influence of industry’s de-technicalization wave, has had to discontinue its eponymic “study through work” technical learning program. Added to this can be the high inflationary costs of private school tuitions, stagnant wages for parents, the widening wealth gap between urban and rural areas, and the large-scale migration of central and south Taiwan cooperative students to the north. All of these have contributed to the decline of cooperative education into a supplemental labor pool for industry, lacking learned technical know-how, and a decline in the job retention rate for graduating students to around 13%. This has resulted in the gradual erosion of the cooperative education system’s main mission and its transformation into a supplemental labor pool subject to the whims of industry.</p></li>

  <li><p>Taking a look at the developmental trends of cooperative education it can be seen that the early stage consisted of training talent for Taiwan’s state enterprises (e.g., Taipower and China National Petroleum Company), to a stage of developing basic technical staff for Taiwan’s infant industries, and finally to the present day situation of providing low-wage personnel for service-based enterprises. The Ministry of Education has taken a passive role in regards to the twin demands of industry for the program: to gradually develop cooperative students and to proactively guide the country’s industrial development. As a result national policy has lost out big, leading to the day-by-day “de-technicalization” of cooperative student learning and the risk of transforming their job market into a pool of temporary jobs. Moreover, the very passage of the “Cooperative Education Student Rights Guarantee Act” was done to turn back this rising tide of part-time jobs. </p></li>

  <li><p>In order to change the current muddled direction of the Ministry of Education’s cooperative education program, which has been led by the profit-motives of private schools and enterprises, the ministry should go back to the original motivations for the program in making a determination for the need to continue with present day enterprise applicants based on the technical content in their applications. Moreover the ministry needs to be proactive in developing participation new programs and training positions for new types of industries, and not passively accept school applications. The task of uncovering potential enterprises with real technical skills amongst the chaos of industry and persuading these employers to give cooperative students training opportunities is none other than the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. Cooperative education is not the purview of employers to be used to their advantage; rather the meeting of real demands for labor is the mission of the cooperative education system. With this in view the program can have a new beginning.</p></li>

### The Right to Equal Education: the Issue of Student Loan Obligations and the Inequitable Allocation of Higher Educational Resources

<ol start="292">
  <li><p>For the 2014 academic year (August 2014 to July 2015), 17,590 high school students nationally still had a need to apply for educational assistance loans in spite of the policy already in place to promote free high school education. Although the Ministry of Education has already established standards on the charging of incidental fees by public and private high schools, however the collection and payment of fees for private institutions remain inconsistent with all sorts of concocted and exorbitant fees being charged: e.g., school uniform fees, dormitory expenses, water and electricity fees, transportation fees, extra-curricular tutorial fees, etc. These additional educational expenses pressure disadvantaged students to apply for loans that compound their financial burdens.</p></li>

  <li><p>Among students entering colleges and universities in 2015 301,664 applied for student loans of which 59,768 (19.8%) were at public institutions and 241,866 (80.2%) were at private institutions. The total number of students in private schools is twice that of those in public schools, nevertheless, the number of students at private schools under the burden of student loans exceeds that of public schools by a magnitude of four. From this it is evident that total financial burden for educational costs is not equally shared, falling disproportionately on the shoulders of private institution students. If recent graduates are added to this, then nationally about 940,000 young adults have yet to repay student debts and more critically 33,000 of them, due to an inability to make payments, have applied for loan deferments. Clearly, under the trend of higher education commercialization, supplemental student loan obligations have already become a heavy burden on the younger generation.</p></li>

  <li><p>In Taiwan, generally speaking public universities in comparison to private universities enjoy more government support, for instance comparatively lower tuition costs, and moreover greater value placed on their degrees in the labor market than those of private institutions. However, among the 220,000 disadvantage students, 170,000 (77%) study at private institutions. Students attending public universities come mainly from socio-economic households ranked as upper-middle class, whereas students at private universities come mainly from lower-middle class households or those below the poverty line. Comprehensively speaking, Taiwan’s system of higher education exacts a higher proportional cost on the lower-middle class and disadvantaged, resulting in an unreasonable burden on the underprivileged for unfairly exorbitant educational costs, providing them comparatively lower cultural capital and essentially recreating another unequal social class. Although the Ministry of Education prepared to alleviate the burdens of those with student debt through “extension of student loan repayment period” to 5 years, however these methods merely postpone repayment periods and do little to help resolve the financial burdens of young graduates nor the institutional exploitation suffered by the poor.</p></li>

  <li><p>Recommendation is for a comprehensive review of standards for the assessment of miscellaneous fees by private high schools and the setting of a duly considered system regulating the charging of miscellaneous expenses by private schools, so as to preclude the impact of exorbitant charges on the rights to education for underprivileged students.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Ministry of Education those applicants for deferred loan repayments who have just entered the labor market so as to proactively understand the reasons for an inability to make payments. The resources of relevant labor and social government departments should be integrated so as to better assist newly employed student loan holders in stabilizing their employment, raising their income and increasing their capacity for repayment.</p></li>

  <li><p>In order to raise the quality of higher education and lighten unreasonable student debt, the Ministry of Education should expedite the promotion of higher education publicization policy, including: the exit system for private schools and review of the publicity efforts of schools for their advanced studies public relations, as well as how community colleges and non-profit organizations can be incorporated into efforts to promote higher education publicization.</p></li>

### Students Withdrawing from Senior High School

<ol start="298">
  <li><p>Due to the promotion of the 12-year national education and the impact of declining birth-rates, the number of school drop-outs has been gradually decreasing. However, there is a group of senior high-school students withdrawing mid-stream prior to graduation that warrant special attention. The reason this merits attention has to do with the statistics from the Ministry of Education for the three year period from 2012 to 2014. In these three years 74,036 students withdrew from senior high school for a yearly average exceeding 20,000. Of those withdrawing from school, the majority, 45,422 (61%), left to stay at home, 17,035 (23%) left to go to work, and 4,587 (6%) left both school and home. From these numbers it can be surmised that 77% of those withdrawing from school are unemployed. A major reason for this is that this group of students leaving school mid-stream belongs for the most part to the difficult to employ population. Therefore, if this group of students who have withdrawn from school do not receive appropriate coaching and transitional services then they will fall into that group of “doubly lost teenagers” having no educational and no employment prospects.</p></li>

  <li><p>In summary, the issue of middle-school withdrawals requires at the very least the setting up of a diverse system of coaching for students who have withdrawn from schools, in addition to the Ministry of Education and educational institutions building a more complete construct of research on the tracking of individuals and the analysis of their backgrounds. Explanation of these reasons as follows: </p></li>

  <li><p>In the Ministry of Education’s plan for students withdrawing before graduation, “Implementation Plan for Senior High School Student Stable Employment and Counseling Mechanisms for Students Withdrawing Mid-studies”(SF2), the focus was on the provisions of counseling for student stable employment, however concrete measures for referrals to relevant employment services resources and other more diverse development opportunities were lacking.</p></li>

  <li><p>The crux of the matter is the need for the Ministry of Education to plan out protocols on diverse counseling and transition mechanisms as well as counseling targets, besides just stable employment, to be directed at those students withdrawing in the middle of their schooling. For those students who do not desire (SF3) employment then Articles 34 and 36 of the “Child and Teenage Rights and Welfare Guarantees Act” should be referenced. Education and Labor authorities should integrate relevant social government departments and link the resources of relevant civic bodies with the measures and resources of relevant employment referral services.</p></li>

  <li><p>The K-12 Education Administration of the Ministry of Education has so far only devised a notification system on senior high school student withdrawals. Measures on counseling also mention the need to provide these students with training and referrals to training resources. However, at present only online resourcesare being provided that do not yet introduce the public and private system employment resources employment offered by the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and various county and city level governments. Therefore the Ministry of Education’s K-12 Education Administration, the Ministry of Labor’s Workforce Development Agency, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s Social and Family Affairs Administration, in accordance with Articles 34 and 36 of the “Child and Teenage Rights and Welfare Guarantees Act” and by means of scheduled meetings that exchange findings and take stock of integrated education, social and labor systems as well as links to the resources of relevant civic bodies, should mobilize relevant employment referral resources and policies for the provision of support to students withdrawing from high school before graduation. In this way the relevant authorities and institutions will be able to better observe the true needs of these students and not merely mouth encouragement for their return to school or passively await to open a case on their 18th birthdays when they become adults.</p></li>

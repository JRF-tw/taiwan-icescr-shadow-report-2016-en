## Article 10 Protection of Families, Children, and Young Persons

<ol start="173">
  <li><p>In reference to Paragraphs 14 to 18 of the Special Chapter on Indigenous People, this chapter entails the care for infants and children for Indigenous families residing in urban areas</p></li>
</ol>

### Inadequate Prenatal and Postnatal Protection for Underage Mothers

<ol start="174">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraphs 161 to 165 on Pages 41 and 42 of the State Report concerning the maternity protection system in Taiwan, the top three reasons for the rise in infant mortality in Taiwan are premature birth, low birth weight, and perinatal pathological changes<sup>27</sup>. The premature birth rate of mothers under the age of 15 is 14.7%, 10% for mothers between the ages of 15 and 19, and 9% for mothers over the age of 19<sup>28</sup>. However, the <em>Genetic Health Act</em> only offers special subsidization for mothers over that of 34, neglecting to protect the high-risk group of underage pregnant persons.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend amending the <em>Genetic Health Act</em> to include medical assistance to younger pregnant women.</p></li>
</ol>

### Daycare System

<ol start="176">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 172 of the <em>State Report</em>, statistics proposed by the Ministry of Education in 2016 that 141,698 children are enrolled in public preschools (30.7%). The other 69.3% are in more costly private preschools. The percentage of children in public preschools decreases concurrently with their age (only 27% of 3-year-old children have the opportunity to enter a public preschool). According to the statistics presented in the 2013 Women Marriage, Fertility, and Employment Survey released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, the average monthly fees for private preschools are NT $8,930, which is twice that of public preschools. Therefore, preschool fees have become a substantial financial burden to parents of young children. Not only has Article 10 of the <em>ICESCR</em> urged countries to provide necessary assistance to families for children’s education, the <em>Early Childhood Education and Care Act</em> also stipulates that the government shall provide all children with high-quality, universal, affordable, and accessible educare services. A substantial gap currently exists between available public educare services and the total ubiquitous of educare services. Moreover, the availability of educare resources varies considerably in different regions of Taiwan. These situations require the immediate attention of the government. We recommend that the government can continue formulating policies to provide free admission to preschool for five-year-old children, establish more affordable public preschools, and provide affordable daycare services for children between the ages of three and four. In addition, the government should endeavor to achieve resource equilibrium throughout Taiwan, providing children in all regions with an equal opportunity to receive public resources.</p></li>
</ol>

### Daycare Services are Inadequate and Expensive; They Fail to Contribute to the Family Care

<ol start="177">
  <li><p>Article 23 of the <em>Act of Gender Equality in Employment</em> stipulates that companies with 250 employees or more should provide breastfeeding and daycare facilities or appropriate childcare measures.<sup>29</sup> However, small and medium enterprises (SME)<sup>30</sup> account for roughly 97.6% of all companies in Taiwan, and the employment population in SMEs account for 78.12%<sup>31</sup> of the overall employment population in Taiwan. Therefore, the majority of the employment population do not benefit from the provisions of Article 23.<sup>32</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>Based on a survey conducted by the Ministry of Labor<sup>33</sup>, only 4.1% of enterprises with 250 employees or more have daycare services. Moreover, among the 77.3% of enterprises that provide daycare measures, 73.8% have arranged with private daycare service institutes. These private daycares are profit-oriented. Therefore, we are doubtful that they provide affordable services that effectively reduce the burden of the parents. Even the Legislative Yuan has outsourced its daycare obligations to private contractors that only provide 10% to 20% discounts, thereby only marginally alleviating parents’ financial burdens<sup>34</sup>.</p></li>

  <li><p>In terms of the <em>5-year-old Child Education Support Plan</em> mentioned in the <em>State Report</em>, over two-thirds of the preschools in Taiwan are private institutes<sup>35</sup>. Therefore, the contribution of “free learning” is limited because private providers may use other forms of payment to turn a revenue. Therefore, the support plan cannot resolve the structural problem of the over-monetization of preschools.</p></li>

  <li><p>The national coverage of the “Elementary After School Care Program” is 66.79%, implying that participating schools remain insufficient. Moreover, the primary issue with this program is the inflexibility of after school care hours. Workers in Taiwan largely leave work relatively late. However, elementary schools only provide after school care services until five or six o’ clock in the evening, which creates a problem for parents to pick up their children. Public after school care services are also not available during the evenings or holidays and private after school classes are expensive. This creates a daycare problem for parents with low incomes or who are required to work at night or on holidays. In addition, the lack of nighttime and holiday care services directly affect the employment opportunities for women with young children and who lack informal support systems. These women are often unable to secure employment due to the inability to find care for their children.</p></li>
</ol>

### Single-Parenting and Grandparenting Families and Anti-Discrimination Measures for Children

<ol start="181">
  <li><p>In response to Paragraph 174 of the <em>State Report</em>, numerous subsidization measures have been proposed in the attempt to balance the living standards of disadvantaged and normal families and to conform with the Article 23 of the <em>ICCPR</em>, which states that families should be protected by society and the country, and Article 9 of the <em>ICESCR</em>, which states that assistance should be provided to families for the care of dependent children and under no circumstances should children be discriminated against. However, general laws and regulations are based on nuclear families. Article 7 of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> concerning special deductions stipulates that special deductions for education tuition are only available to children of a taxpayer studying in a college or university and special deductions for preschool children are only available to taxpayers with children under or equal to five years of age. These initially favorable provisions unintentionally excluded grandparenting families. We recommend that these regulations be revised to include grandparenting families. Moreover, Article 4-5 of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> concerning tax exemptions includes individual, spouse, and children. We recommend that parenting families be included in the tax exemption criteria.</p></li>
</ol>

### Regulations Concerning the Sexual Exploitation of Children

<ol start="182">
  <li><p>Referencing Article 19, Paragraphs 368-371 of the Shadow Report on the ICCPR, this article describes the violation of freedom of expression due to the abuse of police law enforcement.</p></li>
</ol>

### Child Labor (Celebrities) Under the Age of Fifteen

<ol start="183">
  <li><p>In numerous instances, the provisions stipulated in the Regulations Governing the Determination Criteria and Inspection of No Harm to Mental and Physical Health in Article 45 of the Labor Standards Act are more stringent than the Labor Standards Act, particularly in protecting child labor. The lack of centralized regulations in the past resulted in the ratification of numerous labor contracts for child celebrities in accordance with the Labor Standards Act. Provisions in the Regulations Governing the Determination Criteria and Inspection of No Harm to Mental and Physical Health in Article 45 of the Labor Standards Act regulate that children under the age of six shall work no more than two hours per day, those between the ages of six and twelve shall work no more than three hours per day, and those between twelve and fifteen shall work no more than four hours per day. In addition, the number of working days during semester breaks shall not be more than two-thirds the total number of break days and no work is allowed within seven days of the beginning of the semester. These provisions substantially benefited child celebrities, who are students obligated to attend compulsory education.</p></li>

  <li><p>However, contracts pertaining to child celebrities must be reviewed by the local government. This implies that local governments are responsible for investigating illegalities, putting the implementation of the aforementioned provisions in question. Many celebrity agents adopt a non-employment relationship with child actors to evade disadvantageous laws and regulations. Thus, we suggest that stronger intervention should be provisioned.</p></li>
</ol>

### Child Labor and Child Labor Protection

<ol start="185">
  <li><p>In Taiwan, child labor is defined as the employment of persons fifteen years and older and younger than sixteen. The work hours and labor conditions for children over the age of sixteen are the same as general adults. Flexible work hours for children over the age of sixteen and younger than eighteen can be arranged. However, these provisions should be distinguished from those for general adults. We recommend that children over the age of sixteen and younger than eighteen should work no more than ten hours a day and prohibited from working between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.</p></li>

  <li><p>The labor insurance laws and regulations in Taiwan stipulate that companies with less than five employees are excluded from mandatory subscription to labor insurance. However, the majority of underage workers are employed in such companies, implying that they are not protected from occupational accidents. Subsequently, underage workers account for a large percentage of the occupational injury rate per thousand people. We recommend amending provisions concerning occupational injury insurance to include underage workers into mandatory occupational accident insurance.</p></li>
</ol>

### Flaws in the Marriage Interview System and Violation of Family Unification Rights Caused by Visa Flags

<ol start="187">
  <li><p>To prevent the occurrence of sham marriages, the Taiwanese government implemented a transnational marriage interview system between Taiwanese citizens and citizen of 21 Southeast Asian countries. This system constitutes institutional discrimination. Subsequently, the interviewers for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) are assigned to relevant tasks following three days of training. Moreover, the lack of human resources has caused the application process to become extremely tedious. The Control Yuan highlighted numerous flaws in the interview system in its <em>Investigatory Report on the Management and Review of Transnational Marriage Affairs</em> released in 2012.<sup>36</sup> However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has yet to make relevant improvements. The Transnational Marriage Interview and Family Unification Rights Dialogue Forum was held in the TransAsia Sisters Association, Taiwan (TASAT), on 5 November 2014. MOFA dubiously claimed that most of the Vietnamese spouses interviewed were married migrant workers flagged by customs in the attempt to rationalize the overly subjective discretion of its interviewers. Further inspection into the meeting minutes provided by MOFA showed that they were inconsistent with the datasubmitted to the Foreign and National Defense Committee, Legislative Yuan. Moreover, a former first secretary of the Taiwan representative office in Vietnam was indicted by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on suspicion of taking bribes for visa approvals.<sup>40</sup> We recommend that MOFA promptly evaluates its operations in this regard.</p></li>

  <li><p>Article 23 of the <em>Immigration Act</em><sup>41</sup> enables MOFA to flag the visas of overseas spouses that have received their dependent visa with a previous record of overstaying. These flags prevent overseas spouses from converting their temporary visas into permanent visas even if they are legally married, have families, and support their children and parents in Taiwan. They are required to leave the country every two to six months, and they are prohibited from legally working in Taiwan, severely affecting their family unification rights. In response, the Control Yuan produced a corrective measures report<sup>42</sup> targeting the MOFA on 31 July 2009 distinguishing foreign spouses from general foreigners. The measures explicitly state that the approval of visas for general foreigners can be freely decided upon by competent authorities. However, visas for foreign spouses involve the family unification rights of Taiwanese citizens. If MOFA is to exercise the same rights as the National Immigration Agency, it would be required to foresee that the stringency of all laws, regulations, and procedures are consistent with that of the National Immigration Agency. If the competency of MOFA staff cannot match that of other institutes, they cannot flag visas voluntarily without the sufficient capacity to review each individual situation. In accordance with the <em>Investigatory Report on the Management and Review of Transnational Marriage Affairs</em><sup>43</sup> announced by the Control Yuan in December 2012, Article 12 of the <em>Regulations for the Issuance of ROC Visas to Foreign-Passport Holders</em><sup>44</sup> provides vague descriptions concerning the criteria for visa rejection, causing inconsistencies in the review outcomes for dependent visas by representative offices. MOFA should acknowledge the severity of this problem.</p></li>

  <li><p>Flagging visas constitute substantive legal order that serves to issue administrative punishment to the flagged persons. This not only violates administrative procedures stipulated by Taiwanese law, but also breaches provisions concerning family unification and protection stipulated in Articles 10 and 16 of the <em>ICESCR</em><sup>45</sup> and Articles 17, 23, and 24 of the <em>ICCPR</em><sup>46</sup>. In actuality, the MOFA should not have the power to flag visa applications to eliminate the conflicting positions of the National Immigration Agency and the MOFA and the effects that negative processing has on family rights. A private shadow report published in 2012 has clearly highlighted this problem. However, no improvements have been made in the review meetings for laws, regulations, and administration measures hosted by the Ministry of Justice.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend that</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Amendments be made to Article 23 of the <em>Immigration Act</em> to relinquish the right of the MOFA to flag visa applications. Moreover, the National Immigration Agency and the MOFA should cooperatively address this issue before this amendment is ratified. The National Immigration Agency should not treat flags as absolute administrative punishment.</p></li>

      <li><p>Applicants of overseas spouse visas that conform to the exclusion criteria of Article 8 of the <em>Operation Directions for Banning Entry of Aliens</em><sup>47</sup> should be permitted to enter Taiwan. MOFA should not, under any circumstances, flag the visa to prevent violating the applicant’s work and residency rights.</p></li>

      <li><p>MOFA should amend the ambiguous descriptions concerning visa rejection criteria stipulated in Article 12 of the <em>Regulations for the Issuance of ROC Visas to Foreign-Passport Holders</em> as suggested by the Control Yuan.</p></li>

      <li><p>MOFA should immediately revise existing interview procedures, such as the erroneous announcement information on its official website<sup>48</sup>, clarifying to applicants that interviews can be conducted in writing rather than traveling to a specified interview location. Moreover, clear instructions for remedial approaches should be provided and promoted for unsuccessful marriage interviews.</p></li>

      <li><p>Additional funding should be budgeted to remedy the inadequacies in representative offices, such as appointing additional staff to interviews or providing training to enhance interview professionalism and sensitivity.</p></li>

### PRC Asylum Seekers

<ol start="191">
  <li><p>According to principles contained in the <em>State Report on the ICESCR</em>, member countries are requested to provide information concerning economic and social rights of asylum seekers, as well as information concerning their existing legislature and mechanisms to help asylum seekers reunite with their families. The State Report failed to mention that the Taiwanese government previously admitted nine PRC asylum seekers into Taiwan for “conditional legal residence.” However, the wife of one of the asylum seekers, Mr. Peng Yen, remains in the PRC, unable to enter Taiwan for family reunification.</p></li>

  <li>Abstract of the <a href="http://ppt.cc/6vxvq" target="_blank">corrective measures report</a> announced by the Control Yuan on 31 July 2009: The approval or rejection of visas for overseas spouses by MOFA is a political issue rather than a judicial issue. MOFA is clearly in violation of the basic human rights of the claimant and abuses the discretionary power endowed by the Regulations for the Issuance of ROC Visas to Foreign-Passport Holders. Overseas spouse visas should not be rejected in writing and applicants should be advised on remedial approaches to prevent a breach of basic human rights, equality of arms, and proper legal procedures. The approval or rejection of overseas spouse visa applications (temporary or permanent) should be distinguished from applications of general foreigners to prevent a breach of the equality principles stipulated in Article 8 of the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the right to family unification and reunion.</li>
  <li>Page 141 of the Investigatory Report on the Management and Review of Transnational Marriage Affairs announced by the Control Yuan in December 2012 states, “The rejection criteria for visa applications are stipulated in Article 12 of the Regulations for the Issuance of ROC Visas to Foreign-Passport Holders. With the exception of the following: ‘Persons that are unable to sustain themselves in Taiwan or are suspected of engaging in illegal employment,’ ‘persons with evidence of intentional evasion of the law to remain in Taiwan,’ ‘Persons that may damage national interest, public safety, public order, and moral standards.’ These items are considered ambiguous legal concepts that have yet to adopt a determination standard. Thus, they currently cause inconsistencies in the review outcomes for dependent visas by representative offices.”</li>
